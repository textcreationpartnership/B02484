            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whereat the Emperour being moved, changes his former opinion; and thinks now, the neglect of the Sonne to be no leſſe, no other, then an affront offered to the Father. Which alteration of minde, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with change of countenance; when <hi>Amphilochius</hi> had found to be in <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> He unmaskes himſelfe, <hi>Et propoſitum ſui facti declaravit;</hi> by manifeſting the drift of his former carriage. <hi>Nam cum clamore</hi> (as the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſpeakes) For even with clamour and lowd crying, He thus ſpake unto the Emperour: <hi>Itane fers graviter negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem filii tui, &amp;c.</hi> Doeſt thou ſo grievouſly and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly take the neglect of Thy Sonne, and art ſo vehemently inraged againſt thoſe that ſhew themſelves contumacious and contumelious towards him?

            <p>Now that which I would obſerve <hi>(moſt Illuſtrious Prince)</hi> out of this Hiſtory to my preſent purpoſe, is no more
<pb facs="tcp:175623:3"/> but this. That whereas the neglect of doing Divine honour by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to the Sonne of God, occaſioned the neglect of civill honour to be done to <hi>Arcadius,</hi> the Sonne of the Emperour: I inferre, that by the rule of contraries, all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill honour that can poſsibly be deviſed, is to be given to the Sonne of our <hi>Caeſar,</hi> our Emperour, by whom ſo much divine honour is ſo readily and heartily yeelded to the Son of God. For who that is not ſupercilious and ſquint eyed towards his goodneſſe, ſeeth not? or malitiouſly bent againſt his honour and greatneſſe, acknowledgeth not; that our Chriſtian and moſt Religious King, <hi>Defender of the true, Ancient, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke and Chriſtian Faith;</hi> honoureth the Sonne of God many waies? As firſt, in his Chriſtian Lawes and edicts; and ſecondly, in his Chriſtian life and converſation. In the former whereof, as he may be a Preſident to all Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: ſo in the later, a patterne to all Chriſtian people. So that we which are his Subjects, eſpecially, if in the one we will not (or cannot in all things) obey him commanding; yet in the other, we ſhould ſtrive to imitate and follow him, prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and proceeding in the waies of godlineſſe, and Religion before us.</p>
            <p>Next in his reverent and zealous comportment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as well in his publike as more retired devotions. As alſo in his Chriſtian Impreſe upon his Coyne <hi>(CHRISTO AUSPICE REGNO)</hi> profeſsing therein to raigne and rule only by the conduct and guidance of this Son of God.</p>
            <p>In all which particulars and many more, which might be enumerated, ſince our Gracious Soveraigne doth ſo far ſtrive and manifeſt himſelfe to profeſſe to honour the Sonne of God: I ſay, that we ought all of us in our ſeverall callings, to ſtrive likewiſe in a thankefull remembrance thereof, to honour the Sonne of our Soveraigne: laying at his feet as proſtrate before him, even our Perſons, our Prayers, our paines, our wits, our wills, our works, our affections, our actions, our

So that to ſuffer and dye for the ſinnes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, was a chiefe, though not the onely end of his incarnation; which occaſioned the worthy Authors and diſpoſers of this ſh rt ſumme of our Chriſtian beleife, to paſſe from one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall head and point unto another; eſpecially from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and birth, to his paſſion, reſurrection and aſcenſion, with all celerity and expedition, leaving all other circumſtantiall parts and paſſages of his life to their Sermons and other larger diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.</p>
               <p>Which courſe likewiſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe followed as is plainely to be ſeene in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> Where when hee had deſcribed and ſet downe Chriſts nativity and birth; he preſently thereunto adjoynes his death, as fetching and deriving from thence the chiefe fruit and profit of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. His words (ſpeaking of Chriſt) are theſe. Hee made himſelfe of no reputation, but tooke on him the forme of a ſervant, and was made like unto man, and found in ſhape as a man: here he ſpeakes of his Nativity; and then in the next words, ſubjoynes: He humbled himſelfe and became obedient unto the death, even the death of the Croſſe. There followes his paſſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>Verſes.</hi>

For love, true love, without theſe Ceremonies and reſpects, is the more to be admired, and ſo by conſequent the more to be eſteemed: yea, dearer to a man (ſaith one) then either his armes or legges, as being indeed his whole body and ſoule together, anſwerable to that alſo of the Scripture: Or thy friend which is as thine owne ſoule: <hi>Deut</hi> 13.6.

               <p>Now Chriſt for his part had performed all the offices of ſuch a friend unto <hi>Judas,</hi> he had called him to be his Apoſtle, made him his friend, his familiar, cauſed him to eate of his bread, fit at his table, ſuffered him to be of his owne meſſe, and to dip his hand in the diſh with him.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:175623:9"/> the Sacrament, his owne body to eate, and his owne blood to drinke. Becauſe theſe particulars of love and friendſhip towards him, the holy Scriptures doe teſtifie and avow of him. And therefore for <hi>Judas</hi> thus to violate the band of friendſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch a friend, as had done all theſe things for him; and would (if he had found him worthy) have done a great deale more: Yea, that band which hath beene alwayes held ſo ſacred, as not to be violated upon any termes, not onely amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but amongſt the groſſeſt Heathens and prophaneſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatſoever. Why in doing this, I ſay as he hath added one circumſtance, one degree to the ſorrowes, to the ſufferings of Chriſt: ſo many more, I feare not to affirme, to the encreaſe of his owne ſinne, his owne tranſgreſſion: For there can be no greater ſin then the ſin of perfidiouſneſſe, and ingratitude to a faithfull friend. Which made <hi>Jonathan,</hi> that he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray <hi>David</hi> his friend; no, not to his owne Father, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.20. And therefore for <hi>Judas</hi> to doe this, he ſhewed, <hi>Quod majus peccatum habuit,</hi> that he had the greater ſin, as his Maſter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaid of him, <hi>John</hi> 19.11. in that he was <hi>Ingratiſſimus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi> as one ſaith; the moſt ingratefull and unthankfull wretch among the ſons of men.

For this crafty fox, and ſly inſinuating ſerpent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding well enough on which ſide <hi>Iudas</hi> mind was to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted and aſſayled (as having found out) that howſoever he were inclined to many, or as ſome ſay, to any ſinnes, ſo that none came amiſſe unto him; yet eſpecially to this of Covetouſneſſe: <hi>Ea ergo parte boſtem aggreditur, qua ſibi perſuadet aditum faciliùs fore paran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum:</hi> Therefore that he might plant his battery againſt ſuch a breach where he knew before-hand that he ſhould find the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: <hi>ultro currentem ſuadet ulterius currere, &amp;c.</hi> he perſwades him, that was forward and haſty enough of himſelfe, yet to make more

For the truth is, he had once before made tryall how this bait, this ſweet bait of gain would be entertained and ſwallowed by this gaping gudgin: and how his rods would take in this kinde, but he did not, he durſt not peele them, nor pull off the ryne as now he did, but went more cloſely, more covertly to worke. And that was, when he cauſed him to complain of profuſeneſſe and waſte, at <hi>Maries</hi> anointing of the head &amp; feet of our bleſſed Saviour, ſaying, Why was not this oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſold for three hundred pence and given unto the poore? <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.5. thereby hiding and cloaking his covetouſneſſe under an hypocriticall vayle and mantle of charity, and providing for ſuch as were in want: whereas he ſaid this, not that he cared for the poore, but becauſe he was a thiefe, and had the bag, and bare that which was given as there followes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. But now that he is throughly acquainted with the minde and manners of his Client, by this former tryall and experiment of him: <hi>Non in occulto, ſed in aperto pugnat,</hi> hee fights not ſo cloſely, ſo cunningly, but goes more publikely and plainly to worke than he did before. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once found him comming, and gaind his conſent and aſſent unto his wicked and lewd ſuggeſtions, he preſently enters into his ſoule, <hi>Rapit hominem, circum-agitat phantaſmata, non jam ſub Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice virgas, ſed detectas oculis probet videndas:</hi> he violently poſſeſſes the man, compaſſes and canvaſſes his troubled and diſtracted thoughts and wandring and unſetled imaginations, and manifeſts his ſtratagems to the view of the world without any cover, any care to hide or conceale the ſame. For as the Scriptures teſtifie, ſoone after he had received the ſop, Satan entred into him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.27. that is, tooke full poſſeſſion of him, as the marginall notes expound the place: ſo that he led and carried him into what deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſinfull courſes he would himſelfe.</p>

               <p>I had thought beloved, that we had done with <hi>Iudas</hi> the laſt day; yet here you ſee it is our hap to meet with him againe: <hi>Sed tantum mutatus ab illo, ut vix cognoſcas eundem eſſe;</hi> yet ſo changed, as that you will ſcarce know him to be the ſame man. For then he went up and downe like a ſlimme, and a ſly companion, that had gotten ſome ſtolen or counterfeit commodity under a thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare cloake, crying in a corner; Sir, will it pleaſe you to buy? What will you give me? you ſhall have it worth your money; Ile uſe you well, and afford you a very good penny-worth. But here he comes like a brave Gallant, a great Commander, in the head and front of the troupe: He is ſuddenly become a Captaine: Hee hath gotten a Company, and a Band of men; and which is more ſtrange, he hath gotten money to boot. Strange indeed; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve many of our Martialiſts in former times, in the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Low-Countrey</hi> wars, have found it ſo; which have bin fain to make great friends, and disburſe great ſummes themſelves, before they could attain to ſo much honour as to procure a Company: When as <hi>Iudas</hi> ye ſee hath done it in the turne of an hand; or as we ſay, with a wet finger.

               <p>They came out againſt him with ſwords and ſtaves to take him; <hi>Et</hi> Judas <hi>antecedebat eos,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Luke, cap.</hi> 22.47. <hi>i. e.</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> went before them: <hi>tam pedibus, quam moribus,</hi> ſaith one, as well with his feet, as affections of miſchiefe and malice towards him.

He brought them on up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the danger, upon the aſſault, get off againe how they can. But beloved, it ſhould ſeeme by this, that he was not the Captaine, but the Lievtenant rather, whoſe office it is uſually to be the leader and to bring up the men: whereas the Captaine walkes in the rere, comes behinde to keep them cloſe to their rankes and files, and ſee there be no ſtragling nor ſtarting aſide from the company.

               <p>Neither did <hi>Iudas</hi> goe onely before this company; but before and beyond all other traitors that ever were, and ever will be to the worlds end.

The matter firſt, For none ever did or ſhall betray God and Man together in one and the ſame perſon, but he. The manner next, in that he did it with a kiſſe, the token of love: but the moſt treacherous token of the lewdeſt love, and the unkindeſt kiſſe that ever was given. The cauſe, thirdly, none, being not provoked at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were by his owne wicked and corrupt heart and ſinfull ſoule, and the price as little, even thirty pence: which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a valuable conſideration, is as a thing of nought. The cruelty laſt, not being to be paralleld in divers reſpects, by any ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precedent or ſubſequent examples, as ſhall be ſhewed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But I muſt but point, and paſſe, having a long journey to goe.</p>
               <p>But the true reaſon (as it ſhould ſeeme) why <hi>Iudas</hi> went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the company, as it doth appeare by the Evangeliſts, was this: that he might have the better opportunity to kiſſe him. For Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, he had given them a token, ſaying: Whomſoever I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, lay hold on him: and forthwith he came to Jeſus and ſaid, God ſave thee Maſter, and kiſſed him, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.48.49. Whereupon our Saviour Chriſt replied unto him againe, ſaying; <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayeſt thou the Sonne of man with a kiſſe? <hi>Luke</hi> 22.48.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Hugo Cardinalis</hi> on the 84 <hi>Pſalme,</hi> reckons up ſundry ſorts of kiſſes, that are ſpoken of and rehearſed in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and word of God.

               <p>Now, if any demand the reaſon why <hi>Judas</hi> gave this ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a kiſſe for his token; it is rendred by Expoſitors to be this. Becauſe Chriſt after the faſhion and cuſtome, that was then in uſe amongſt his Countrey-men the <hi>Jewes,</hi> (and alſo amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and other Nations; as it were eaſie to ſhew, if it were much materiall) did ordinarily after that loving and familiar manner entertaine his Diſciples and Apoſtles at their returne, when at any time they had beene abſent from him for a ſeaſon: <hi>Vt oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret regreſſum &amp; ingreſſum eorum eſſe gratum, &amp; pacificum;</hi> that ſo hee might manifeſt unto them that their entrance and returne was very welcome and acceptable unto him. And therefore <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> that he might be the leſſe ſuſpected, of having any ill minde or meaning towards his Maſter; came onely in this ordinary and loving way of ſalutation, crying, <hi>Hayle Maſter, and kiſſed him;</hi> as you heard before: that ſo they that knew him not, either by face or favour, might take notice which was he, and ſo be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh him from the reſt of his company, and to take the right man, by not miſtaking one for another, which was all they cared for, their malitious mindes being more bent againſt him, then any: nay, then all the reſt. And they had ſome reaſon to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitious, and jealous of his eſcape; becauſe he had conveyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſecretly from them, at the leaſt once before: as you may ſee, <hi>John</hi> 8. and the laſt <hi>verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Jeſus</hi> takes it ill at <hi>Judas</hi> hands, that he ſhould make <hi>Sigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum dilectionis ſignum perditionis;</hi> the ſeale of love the ſigne of treachery, and a kiſſe the key of his Treaſon; by which himſelfe had manifeſted ſo much love to him, aſwell as to his fellow Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: and therefore cryes unto him as you have heard, <hi>Judas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeſt

                  </label> Now then, if theſe things have beene done ſo long ſince, not onely to the Saints, but alſo to the Sonne of God; why then, let us be contented with like patience to ſuffer, if at any time we be tryed with the like aſſaults. Let us be content, willingly to put up injuries at all mens hands, ſeeme they friends or foes; for in ſo doing, we ſhall heape coales of fire upon their heads, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come conformable to the example of Chriſt, that hath done the like before us, and for us. Let us neither curſe nor revile thoſe that have offered ſuch indignities and injuries to us, nor yet provoke them farther by biting and bitter language; but onely reprove them friendly, as Chriſt did <hi>Judas,</hi> and the <hi>Jewes;</hi> when he ſaid unto the one, <hi>Judas, betrayeſt thou the Sonne of man with a kiſſe;</hi> and to the other, <hi>Yee be come out unto me as to a theefe, with ſwords and ſtaves;</hi> and the like: For, <hi>Quis erit impatiens in feren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da injuria ab amico,</hi>

               <p>Secondly, take notice what a dangerous thing it is to betray Chriſt with a kiſſe, as all hypocriticall profeſſors doe; and ſuch as making ſhewes of religion and devotion outwardly and to the world, are yet in their hearts and ſoules neither truly religious, nor devout indeed; but having only a forme of godlineſſe, have denied the power thereof, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. And likewiſe ſuch as eat the body, and drinke the bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament, when as they are neither truly ſorrowfull for their ſinnes, nor in love and charity with their neighbors, neither yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:175623:20"/> to lead new lives; but come only for cuſtome and faſhion ſake, as compelled thereunto more by law than love: and therefore doe not earneſtly hunger and thirſt after the righteouſneſſe of God and his Chriſt; but retaine ſtill <hi>voluntatem peccandi;</hi> a will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to returne to their old ſins againe, as the dog to his vomit, and the ſow to her wallowing in the mire. But theſe I ſay, yea all theſe betray Chriſt with a kiſſe, in making ſhewes of being his followers and ſervants, when as in their hearts and minds they are nothing leſſe. And therefore in their ſo doing they are no other, no better than very traytors alſo to their owne ſoules.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let all Gods children learne hence, to beware of the faire face and flatteries of the world, which is nothing elſe but a traytor and a falſe friend to all thoſe upon whom it fawneth moſt; ſmiling upon ſome with the pleaſing lookes of wealth and riches, kiſſing others with the lips of love and pleaſures; and hugging and embracing a third ſort in the armes of honour and preferment; and ſo under the ſhewes of friendſhip, betraying all to eternall death and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, let every one as Chriſt adviſeth his Apoſtles and Diſciples; beware of thoſe that come unto them in ſheeps cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but inwardly are ravening wolves; Let them beware of them, I ſay, that they doe not worke them a miſchiefe before they are aware. For, <hi>Quando bonum ore faris, mala corde tamen meditaris, Oſcula quae Domino Judas dedit haec mihi, tu das;</hi> Their kindneſſes are but like <hi>Judas</hi> kiſſes, watching opportunities to betray thee into thine enemies hands. And therefore ſaith the Poet: <hi>Timeo Danaos &amp; dona ferentes:</hi> an enemies kiſſes are wounds: the overmuch and ſudden kindneſſe of ſuch men as theſe, are but the very markes of treaſon. For he that uſeth me better than he was wont, will betray me, ſaith the Italian proverbe. And the heavenly Proverbs of Gods Word affirme, That the bitter wounds of a lover are better than the ſweet and ſugred kiſſes of an enemy that hates thee to the death, as you have heard before out of <hi>Proverbs</hi> 7.13. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Prophet adviſeth, ſo let me: truſt not a friend, neither put confidence in a Counſellor; but keep the doores of thy mouth from her that lyeth in thy boſome. For the ſon revileth the father, the daughter riſeth up againſt her mother, the daughter in law againſt her mother in law, and a mans enemies are they of his own houſe, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.5, 6. And this ſufficeth for the kiſſe of <hi>Judas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſaith Chriſt, ye be come out unto me as againſt a theefe,

Death, <hi>Quia inſidiatur vitae,</hi> becauſe it ſeekes to kill us and deprive us of our lives; and the wicked man, <hi>Quia inſidiatur bonis,</hi> he ſeekes to ſteale from us and rob us of our goods. Now the laſt of theſe thou ſaveſt, ſo many of them as will repent with the good theefe, and put their truſt in thee. And the other two thou vanquiſheſt, ſo that they ſhall not prevaile either againſt thee or thine, to their deſtruction or confuſion: as will be manifeſted more at large in that which will follow and enſue upon this ſubject, when we ſhall come to ſpeake of thy death, buriall, and the like. And therefore if theſe thine enemies uſe thee as a theefe in comming out againſt thee with ſwords and ſtaves, torches, and lanthornes, and ſuch other inſtruments as whereby they uſed to take and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend theeves and robbers withall; it is but thy fathers juſtice againſt our ſins, which thou cameſt into the world moſt cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and willingly to ſatisfy &amp; undergo. But yet I muſt confeſſe, that ſeeing thou wert innocent as well from theſe as all other offences, both thy ſufferings and thine enemies ſinnes are the greater, in that they did theſe things unto thee without thy deſert. And therefore there is a great deale of reaſon, that they ſhould be puniſhed and thou pitied accordingly. For if it be a thing much to be condoled and lamented to ſee an innocent and honeſt man
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:175623:21"/> to be apprehended, and violently laid hold upon: yea, drag'd and haled, pinioned and manacled too, and ſo carried to priſon; and thence afterward brought to the Barre, and forced to anſwer for his life: then much more when theſe things are done, <hi>Coelorum &amp; Angelorum Domino,</hi> to him that is Lord both of Heaven and Earth, as it was unto our bleſſed Saviour; who as the Prophet ſpeaketh, was led as a ſheep unto the ſlaughter: <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.7.</p>
               <p>Wherefore our Saviour did but juſtly complaine of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, in ſaying, They came out unto him as to a theefe, when they came to take him. For whereas it is the property of theeves, firſt, to ſteale and rob men of their goods; and then to fly and run away after they have ſtollen, according to that queſtion and demand at the Barre; Did he fly for the ſame? as alſo to hide and conceale themſelves in corners and obſcure places, and many times to lay violent hands; yea, to hurt and wound thoſe that ſhall ſeeke to reſiſt and withſtand them in their robberies; as it is ſaid of the <hi>Bandettees</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> that they ſeldome rob, but they kill too: Why, Chriſt did never any of theſe things; but was ſo farre from doing them, as that he did the cleane contrary. For inſtead of flying, he went to meet them when they came to take him; and when the officers knew him not, hee told them that he was the man: <hi>Vliro ſe dans in manus eorum;</hi> yeelding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe willingly and readily of his owne accord into their hands. And inſtead of hurting, or being any wayes in ſuch kinde prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to any man, he did infinite good to all men; healing them of all manner of ſickneſſes and ſores, that ſtood in need of his helpe either of thoſe wayes. And laſtly, he was ſo farre from robbing, or taking any thing unjuſtly from them, as that hee would never be ſole owner, or poſſeſſe any temporall thing as his owne: but rather ſpend and imploy all ſuch things as he had, as his gifts and graces; his labour and his learning; yea, and his very life, and all, for the benefit and ſalvation of others: and therefore I ſay, it was a great point of injuſtice in them thus to come out unto him as to a theefe, with ſwords and ſtaves.</p>

                  <hi>Iob</hi> 19.13, 14. So that he may juſtly complain in the words of a moderne Poet of our owne:

                     <l>Betwixt my friends and me. They leave the ſtarre,</l>
                     <l>That brought the Wiſe men of the Eaſt from farre.</l>
                  </q> But the truth is, he was for a time forſaken of his heavenly Father himſelfe; which made him to cry when he was upon the Croſſe, and that with a lowd voice too, ſaying, <hi>Eli, Eli, Lamaſabackthani, i. e. My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Math.</hi> 27.46. And therefore it is the leſſe wonder, that he ſhould be ſo of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Diſciples, which were but weak and faint-hearted, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſinfull men. Neither did they doe it without a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, for <hi>Percute paſtorem &amp; diſpergentur Oves gregis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Zachary, i. e.

And if we finde our hearts to be ſo firmely ſet and ſetled, that we will rather forſake all, than foregoe our Maſter Chriſt Jeſus; our reſolution in this kinde ſhall paſſe for execution, in the ſight of God; and it ſhall be held as done, which we would have done, if we had beene put unto it, though it never bee done indeed. For, <hi>Non Martyrium ſola effuſio ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis conſummat</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin) nec ſola dat palmam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſtio illa flammarum:</hi> It is not the ſword alone, nor the fire, which makes a Martyr, but a man may be a Martyr without blood-ſhed; <hi>Et ſicca morte;</hi> and by a dry death, attaine unto the Crowne of a Confeſſor.</p>

               <p>Now beloved, we muſt reſolve to be Martyrs in this laſt kinde at the leaſt, or elſe we are not worthy the name of Chriſtians. We muſt reſolve therefore, I ſay, to continue and abide by Chriſt, not onely in his, but in all our owne temptations alſo, or elſe we can never bee partakers of his glory among the Saints of light. For there is no hope of the Crowne, if we doe not helpe in ſome meaſure to carry the Croſſe; neither can we be ſharers of the ſpoiles and booty, if we fight never a ſtroke in the battaile: But either cowardly (with the Apoſtles here) runne away from Chriſt; or with Saint <hi>Peter</hi> deny him, rather than runne the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of perſecution which may ariſe for his names ſake. For whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me and of my words, among this adulterous and ſinfull generation; him ſhall the Sonne of man be aſhamed of when he commeth in the glory of his Father with all his holy Angels, ſaith our Saviour himſelfe, <hi>Marke</hi> 8.38. And therefore if you would have Chriſt not to forſake you in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world, doe not you forſake him in this, whether in word or deed, practiſe or profeſſion, heart or hand, but be conſtant in your
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:175623:26"/> Faith holding out unto the end; notwithſtanding never ſo many dangers which may threaten you for your profeſſion ſake. For all the afflictions of this life are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be ſhewed unto us in the life to come, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.18. And this ſufficeth for this uſe.</p>

                  </note>Secondly, Take notice that theſe Diſciples followed Chriſt, <hi>Vſque ad Paſſionis tempus;</hi> as one obſerveth, <hi>i. e.</hi> Till the time that his Death and Paſſion drew neere and was at hand; but then they forſooke him and fled: ſo thy Parents, Kinsfolke, Children and Friends, and all other good things of this world, will be content to ſerve and attend thee whileſt thou art alive, and to live like, as we ſay: But when the miniſters and meſſengers of death begin once to beſet and encompaſſe thee about, they will all forſake thee preſently, and leave thee to thy ſelfe alone: Which may afford us this uſe to teach us not to put our truſt in men, nor in any other earthly thing, but onely in the Lord our moſt faithfull and conſtant friend indeed, that will ſtand to us, and by us, not only in this life, but in that other life alſo which is to come. But I was ſo large and long in the laſt Vſe, that I am conſtrained to be the briefer in this. And therefore I doe here end it, when I have ſcarce made entrance into it: onely ſhewing you that ſuch an uſe might be made of it, though I have no time now to inlarge and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it; but am inforced to leave the farther application and amplification of it unto your ſelves.</p>
               <p>There is one circumſtance behinde, and that is <hi>Peters</hi> deniall of his Maſter, which might have beene here added as a great increaſe no doubt of the mentall ſufferings of our bleſſed Saviour. But I ſhall purpoſely omit it becauſe it is a ſubject that is very copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly handled by divers others, and that hath beene likewiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly treated of by my ſelfe in this place; ſo that I ſhould but <hi>actum agere,</hi> doe that which I had done before, to inſiſt upon it againe. And therefore, the next day (God willing) I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed directly to his corporall paſſions, and that which for our ſakes he ſuffered in his body, when as it is ſaid, <hi>He ſuffered under Pontius Pilate.</hi> In the meane time, for this preſent, this ſhall ſuffice.</p>

               <p>But oh you unthankfull and ungratefull wretches, is this the reward you give unto him, that ſet you free from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage; thus to binde him for his paines? to tye thoſe hands that created and made at the firſt, and ſtill preſerve and uphold the whole frame of this univerſall world? And which is more, are the authors of that liberty and freedome which your ſelves doe now enjoy? (For I am the Lord the God, which have brought you out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that you ſhould not be their bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: yea, I have broken the bonds of your yoke, and made you goe upright, ſaith this Lord himſelfe unto them: <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.13.) <hi>Haeccine ergo reddis Domino, popule ſtulte &amp; inſipiens;</hi> Doe yee therefore ſo reward the Lord O yee fooliſh people, and unwiſe? ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> unto them long ſince: as you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6.

               <p>And therefore it is but a point of folly, if not madneſſe in them indeed, to comfort and ſolace themſelves overmuch, in this their new priſoners bondage, ſeeing although they have bound him, yet they have not vanquiſhed nor overcome him: For, <hi>Quod vinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, non victi eſt ſed volentis;</hi> His bonds proceed not ſo much from their conqueſt, as from his owne conſent. And beſides, in this their binding of him, they doe but tye themſelves both bodies and ſoules the faſter, and the ſurer to their owne damnation: as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed doe all others, that in theſe dayes doe likewiſe tye the hands
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:175623:28"/> of our bleſſed Saviour by their ſinnes: as firſt they doe, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtruſt his providence over them, for the proviſion and welfare of their bodies; or deſpaire of his mercy towards them for the ſalvation of their ſoules: or laſtly, that doubt of his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in any other their temptations and afflictions; whether cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or ſpirituall, whether of minde, or body, or both.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they doe the like, which doe ſo reſiſt his divine and holy motions and inſpirations, which many times hee breatheth and infuſeth by his heavenly blaſts, into their hearts and ſoules; as that they doe not permit and ſuffer him to have his free opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and worke out his owne worke within them: but either careleſly neglect him, or wilfully reject him when he offers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace unto them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they that are ungratefull and unthankfull for benefits and bleſſings formerly received, doe alſo ſo tye up Gods hands, as that hee can conferre and beſtow no more upon them; but doe plainly manifeſt and declare, that they are very unworthy of thoſe, which they have already had, and received.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they which upon all occaſions are not ready and willing to cooperate with Gods divine grace, by faithfull and carefull imployment of their talents to farther and greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and increaſe; but are ſo cold and ſloathfull in good things, as that they bury and hide their talents: and rather extinguiſh and quench the ſpirit, then cauſe it to flame and burne out, as they ought to doe, by being diligent and zealous in good works; free and forward to all holy actions and endeavours. For, <hi>Agun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur homines à Spiritu Dei; ut acti agant, non ut ipſi nihil agant,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin;</hi> Men are ſo led and guided by the Spirit of God, as that by his aſſiſtance they muſt alſo worke and agitate themſelves; and not doe nothing towards their owne ſalvation: which the very word Aſſiſtance doth plainly import. For he that doth helpe and aſſiſt his friend in any thing, doth it not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for him; but together with him, doth helpe to perfect that which he was not able to finiſh, and fulfill by himſelfe alone. So, that as the ſame <hi>Auſtin</hi> elſewhere, <hi>Qui fecit te ſine te, non ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit te ſine te;</hi> He that made thee without thee, yet will not ſave thee without thee.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, the proud <hi>Juſtitiaries,</hi> which are ready preſently to thinke highly, and magnify themſelves for thoſe good things that are in them; (although they be not <hi>nata,</hi> but <hi>data;</hi> not their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:175623:28"/> owne, but ſuch as they have received from the Lord: and with the <hi>Phariſee</hi> in the Goſpell, to boaſt and bragge of their owne righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, above, and beyond others; and that with a kinde of ſcornefull rejection, and diſdainfull deteſtation and demonſtration of <hi>Iſte Publicanus,</hi> The poore <hi>Publican,</hi> and all other their neighbours and brethren in compariſon of themſelves: as too many in theſe dayes doe. Why theſe I ſay; yea all theſe do ſo binde and tye up the hands of our bleſſed Saviour and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as that he cannot goe forward with the worke of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, no more then he could doe his great workes and wonders in his owne Countrey, and among his owne people, for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefes ſake: as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.58. and <hi>Marke</hi> 6.5. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let me entreat and perſwade you, to beware of theſe and the like fearefull ſinnes, if ever you meane that God and his Chriſt ſhall ſave your ſoules.</p>
               <p>And thus in the flight firſt of his Diſciples, and then in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and binding of our Saviour himſelf afterward; ye ſee the truth of thoſe things fulfilled in theſe dayes of the Goſpell, which were long ſince typified and fore-ſhowne in the time of the Law. Firſt, in the flying of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> before their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the taking of the Arke of God; at the newes whereof old <hi>Eli</hi> fell backeward from his ſeat, ſo that his necke was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and he dyed: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.18. where, ſince the taking of the Arke, was a token and a type of the taking of Chriſt; (as many Writers obſerve) I ſee no reaſon but that I may ſafely infer, that the fall and breaking of the neck of <hi>Eli,</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at that time, might fore-ſhew alſo the downefall and deſtruction of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſthood, and Eccleſiaſticall Policy, at the taking, or ſhortly after the taking of our Lord himſelfe: but this onely by the way. Secondly, the binding and durance of Chriſt was typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the caſting of innocent <hi>Joſeph</hi> into priſon, becauſe hee would not conſent to lie with his laſcivious and adulterous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris: <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.20.

For who ever heard before that Judges did act the parts, either of pleaders or accuſers; or went about to enquire for falſe witneſſes, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orne them to come in againſt a priſoner at the Barre; or one that ſtood before them to anſwer for his life, as theſe Judges did? For Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Marke</hi> both tell us, that aſwell the chiefe Prieſts and Elders, as the reſt of the Counſell, ſought for falſe witneſſes to put him to death: <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.59. and <hi>Marke</hi> 14.55. whereby it appeares that they were very enemies unto him, upon whoſe life they meant to ſit as Judges; which was a moſt wicked and unlawfull act in them: and ſuch as made Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon a like occaſion to refuſe to ſtand to:<note place="margin">Eccl.

                  </note> ſaying, <hi>Se nolle temerarium aliquid ſubire &amp; manifeſtos inimicos ferre judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as <hi>Sozomen</hi> relates; That he would not abide by any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or cenſure that ſhould be given by his enemies. And it is an ordinary and uſuall practiſe in the Courts of Juſtice amongſt our ſelves, for a priſoner, if he know, or but ſuſpect any of the Jury to be his enemies, to challenge them; and they ſhall be put by from paſſing upon his life or cauſe. And in ſome caſes, if a man doubt of the integrity or uprightneſſe of any Court, whether Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, or Temporall; he may remove his action, and cry with Saint <hi>Paul, Appello Caeſarem,</hi> I appeale unto <hi>Caeſar;</hi> or ſome higher Bench: whereas our Saviour ye ſee here does none of theſe things, but is content to let them take their courſe againſt him, though his own innocency be never ſo eminent and evident, and their injuſtice and iniquity never ſo great.</p>
               <p>But indeed, the truth is, theſe were the ſupreameſt Courts of that place and time, in which his cauſe was to be tryed, aſwell Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall as Imperiall; of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as the Synagogue: ſo that from theſe, except to the Throne of Heaven, there lay no appeale. Now if this be not a great degree of ſuffering in him, thus to fall into the hands, not onely of his enemies, but ſuch as were unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judges alſo: yea, ſo many of them; all foure ſuch, never

For where all are ſuch, as in this caſe of Chriſt, that there is never an honeſt or righteous man upon the Bench; there righteouſneſſe it ſelfe is ſure to be arraigned, and innocency condemned; Juſtice perverted; and all Lawes, be they never ſo ſacred and religious, violated and broken.</p>
               <p>Now in our Saviours caſe, I ſay, beſides that ſome of them had declared and manifeſted themſelves to be his enemies: why the others alſo, aſwell as they, were wicked and unjuſt too; there being not one of them ready, <hi>patrocinare,</hi> or to defend the cauſe of this innocent: no nor to ſpeake a word to purpoſe on his behalfe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were the moſt righteous and harmleſſe perſon that ever the world brought forth, but he ſuffered ſome kinde of injury and indignity or other from them all, every one of them apart, as ſhall appeare unto you more plainly by that which followes and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds. For howſoever <hi>Pilat</hi> made a ſhew indeed of pleading his cauſe againſt the Jewes for a time: yet the cataſtrophe and cloſe of all will make it manifeſt, that he was as wicked and unjuſt in his degree and kind as any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>But let us take them in their order. For Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tels us, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:175623:31"/> they led him away to <hi>Annas</hi> firſt; who was father in law to <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphas,</hi> which was high Prieſt the ſame yeare, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>3. So that howſoever the cogniſance of the cauſe at this time belonged pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> as being the preſent high Prieſt, yet the catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles and ſouldier, that tooke and haled him along, carryed him firſt to <hi>Annas; non tanquam ad judicem ſed ad hoſtem; veluti praedam oſtentantes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In locum.</note> as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſpeaks: not as to a Judge that had power to cenſure him: but as to an adverſary, that had a deſire to ſee him, thus under arreſt, and in his enemies hands. And therefore as brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and vaunting of their prey, and glorying in their conqueſt over him, they carry him unto him, who they knew would rejoice together with them; and give them praiſe and thanks, rather then the leaſt diſcountenance for what they had done unto him. And beſides, <hi>Annas</hi> as it is probably to be thought, was of the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy to take him, being one of thoſe that had hired <hi>Judas</hi> to betray him; and procured the band of ſouldiers from the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to aſſiſt and helpe him in the action and imployment. For three of the Evangeliſts, <hi>viz. Matthew, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> doe all tell us, <hi>That he went to the high Prieſts,</hi> in the Plurall number: and <hi>They,</hi> not <hi>He; appointed unto him thirty pieces of ſilver, &amp;c.</hi> as Mat. 26.14.15. Now then, There being more then one of theſe high Prieſts that had done thus, <hi>Annas</hi> muſt needs be the ſecond man; becauſe we reade not of any other about this time, but onely of <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas:</hi> who by turnes, as it ſhould ſeeme, had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the high Prieſts office for ſome while together; as appeares by the relation of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> who ſaith, That <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> were the high Prieſts when the word of God came unto <hi>John</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Zacharias;</hi> and he began to preach in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.2. Now then, if theſe were the men that had promiſed <hi>Judas</hi> his pay, and it may be the ſouldiers ſome gratuity for their paynes; why then, they had reaſon to repayre unto them both, to give an account of their imployment and undertaking, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>Annas</hi> firſt, as being the Elder man, and one whoſe habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was neerer then the other,<note place="margin">In locum.</note> as Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> and ſome others doe imagine and conceive. But whatſoever were the true cauſe, it is evident and apparent by Saint <hi>Johns</hi> relation, that to him he was firſt carried and brought. Neither did he take himſelfe to be ſo voyded and deprived of all juriſdiction, but that he had power and durſt preſume to examine him, and queſtion with him. For ſo is it ſaid, That the high Prieſt asked him of his Diſciples and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:175623:31"/> of his Doctrine, <hi>John</hi> 18.19. which the ancients generally allow to be <hi>Annas;</hi> though <hi>Calvin,</hi> I muſt confeſſe,<note place="margin">In locum.</note> and many other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oterickes thinke otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was not queſtioned at all, till he came into the common Councell: And then that <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> was he that did it; <hi>Annas</hi> being preſent, and ſitting by as his aſſiſtant upon the bench; or at the leaſt, that this queſtion was not dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nded him till then; unto which hee gave that anſwer, which occaſioned a ſtander by to ſtrike him. For hereupon, He the ſaid <hi>Calvin,</hi> takes occaſion to obſerve the exceſſive rage and unrulineſſe of theſe enemies of Chriſt; together with the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall diſcipline that was exerciſed by theſe high Prieſts: That while they ſeeme to ſit as Judges, <hi>Interea ſaeviunt, ut truculentae bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luae;</hi> yet they are as ſavage as the moſt furious and fierceſt beaſts. For in the midſt of their Councell and Aſſembly, where ought of all places to be exerciſed and ſhewne the greateſt gravity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum in their proceedings, a common officer or ſervant amongſt them, aſſumes ſo much licenſe and liberty to himſelfe, as in the very time of examination and handling of the cauſe, in the open face of the court; and in ſight of both the Judges; to ſtrike the priſoner even without any offence, and that without any checke or reproofe from them againe for his ſo doing. And thereupon concludes: <hi>Non mirum ſi intam barbarico conſeſsu damnatur Chriſti doctrina; a quo non modo eis aequitas exulat, ſed eis quo que humanitas &amp; pudor.</hi> It is no marvell that the Doctrine of Chriſt ſhould be condemned in ſuch a barbarous aſſembly, whence not onely all right and equity, but even all ſhame alſo and humanity is baniſhed and exiled; ſo far <hi>Calvin.</hi> And <hi>Buiſſonius</hi> in his Evangelicall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſaith; <hi>Non dubium eſt, quin Iohannes nomine Pontificis, non An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, ſed Caiapham intelligit:</hi> It is not to be doubted, but that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> by the name of high-prieſt in this place, meanes not <hi>Annas</hi> but <hi>Caiaphas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when, or where, or by whomſoever this queſtion was askt; it is evident by the text, that when Chriſts anſwer thereunto plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not the ſtanders by, one of them, <hi>dedit ei alapam,</hi> ſaith the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine, <hi>i. e.</hi> gave him a boxe on the eare, or as our laſt tranſlation reads it, ſmote him with the palme of his hand, ſaying, Anſwereſt thou the high-prieſt ſo? <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. of the former eighteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Goſpell written by Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> Whereupon Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> exclaimes:<note place="margin">In locum.</note>

And yet thus our poore Saviour was contented to be ſerved; to be uſed and abuſed for our ſakes: yea, he was carryed to the high Prieſt, <hi>Cujus erat de lepra judicare,</hi> To whom it belonged to judge and determine of the leproſie: <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8. <hi>Quia reputavimus eum quaſi leproſum;</hi> becauſe the wicked doe eſteeme no otherwiſe of him, then as of one leprous and ſmitten of God, as the Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.4. Nay, falſe witneſſes are alſo ſought, for to come in againſt him; whereby under the colour of Law, they might the more ſecurely and without danger of uproare and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult among the people, ſeeme to have ſome juſt cauſe to take away his life. As <hi>Jezabell</hi> dealt with <hi>Naboth,</hi> ſo doe theſe pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wals with Chriſt: Becauſe he would not give his Vineyard to the oppreſſor, Set (ſaith ſhe) two men, ſonnes of <hi>Beliall,</hi> before him; which may beare witneſſe againſt him, as if he had blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med God and the King: 3 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. So becauſe Chriſt would not give his Fathers honour unto the Devill, when he bade him fall downe and worſhip him; falſe witneſſes by his, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments inſtigation and procuring, are ſought for to ſlander and accuſe him unjuſtly, laying to his charge things that hee did not, that hee knew not, ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt: Pſal.</hi> 35.11. So that the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:175623:34"/> mouth of the wicked, and of the deceitfull are opened againſt him, ſpeaking againſt him with a lying tongue: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.2. compaſſing him about with words of hatred, and fighting againſt him without a cauſe, as there followes, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. without a cauſe indeed. For, though I have redeemed them, yet they have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken lyes againſt me; as himſelfe complaineth by his Prophet, of them and their ingratitude: <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7.13.</p>
               <p>But there was a ſeeming ſhew and pretext, I muſt confeſſe, of much ſincerity and uprightneſſe in their proceedings againſt him. For here is a Councell ſolemnly called, and met as you ſee, and that of the greateſt and graveſt; the learnedſt and the wiſeſt men amongſt them, as of high Prieſts, Scribes, Elders; beſides the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators and by ſtanders; before whom it could not be thought, or once imagined, but that all things ſhould be fairely and uprightly carried, by ſuch an Aſſembly: ſo that as one ſaith, <hi>Quis non bona ſperaſſet ab hoc coetu, &amp; multitudine, &amp; reverentia tam illuſtri?</hi> Who could expect any thing but good from this ſo famous and illuſtrious a convention and meeting, aſwell in multitude and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſneſſe, as reverence and ſhew of honeſty? <hi>Specioſa enim hic multa;</hi> Seeing here were met together ſo many faire and ſpecious pretexts of nothing elſe but ſincere and upright dealings, as a congregation and gathering together of the moſt renowned and famous men of the City; a certaine forme of judicature after an orderly and ſolemne ſort: a production of ſeverall witneſſes, and the like. <hi>Sed larvata haec omnia,</hi> All theſe are but masked and diſſembling appearances; a vizard only, and no true face of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: ſeeing the text tells us, that for all their faire ſhewes, their intent was foule; even to put him to death: ſo that he had his doome before his day of hearing, and his judgement before his tryall. For, <hi>Ante coitionem conſulta decreta, facta &amp; fata ſunt omnia,</hi> ſaith one; All things were determined and decreed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, before ever they came together; which is a peece of the greateſt injuſtice, and a knack of the lewdeſt and vileſt kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, that either the Devill can invent, or his inſtruments actuate: when a man ſhall have his cauſe ſentenced before it be heard, and himſelfe condemned before he be legally convict: this is right devilry indeed. And yet this is our Saviours caſe in this aſſembly, witneſſes againſt him are pretended to be ſought; but yet they muſt be falſe ones, ſpeaking as the Court and Councell would have them; or elſe they ſhall not be heard. For, ſeeing Truth is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:175623:34"/> to be condemned, it muſt be done by falſhood, or not at all: and therefore, all you that are lovers and friends to Truth, ſtand by: here's no need of your teſtimony at this time: <hi>Hac curia non vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis patet;</hi> The doores and gates of this Aſſembly are ſo farre from being open to you, as that on the contrary, they are ſhut againſt you: ſo that, <hi>Exeat hac aula qui vult eſſe pius;</hi> He that is ſo godly and ſtrict in his Religion, as that he cannot be content either to ſpeake, or heare leaſings; to equivocate a little, and ſtretch his conſcience; to pleaſure his friends, and confound his foes: hee may, nay he muſt depart the Court.</p>
               <p>It is very fitting, I muſt needs ſay, that all publike Officers and Magiſtrates, for their better advice, direction, and information in all caſes, ſhould have their Aſſiſtants and Counſellours of State, and publike acts be done in publike aſſemblies: as well for the praiſe, and honour, and incouragement of thoſe that doe well; as for the open and exemplary puniſhment and conviction of thoſe that doe offend. In regard whereof it is true which one ſaith, <hi>Conſilium eſt bonum;</hi> Counſell is good: (For, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi conſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, ibi prudentia;</hi> Where there is Counſell, there is Wiſedome, ſaith a wiſe man indeed: and where no Counſell is, the people fall; but where there are many Counſellers there is health, ſaith <hi>Solomon; Prov.</hi> 11.14.) but yet take this withall, as mine Author addes: <hi>Si ſit bonorum,</hi> if it be of good men, and to good purpoſes. For otherwiſe the meetings and Aſſemblies, Councels and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles of the wicked, are dangerous and deadly; becauſe they travell of miſchiefe, and bring forth ungodlineſſe, ſaith <hi>David. Pſal.</hi> 7.15. Yea, The Kings of the earth ſtand up, and the Rulers take counſell together; but wherefore is it? even to deſtroy the Lord, and his annointed: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. As likewiſe it is ſaid of the <hi>Phariſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es,</hi> That they went out, and tooke counſell againſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> how to deſtroy him; <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.14. and what they plotted and adviſ'd upon then, that they put in practice now. For in this their publike Aſſembly, in the high Prieſts houſe, they ſeeke for falſe witneſſes to put him to death: So that this ſurely was no juſt and lawfull Councell, but a rude and diſorderly Conventicle of bloud-ſeeking, and bloud-ſucking Tyrants: like that of <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, when moſt unnaturally they conſpired againſt their owne innocent and harmeleſſe brother to ſlay him: <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.18, 20. <hi>verſes.</hi> And that of the <hi>Jewes</hi> againſt <hi>Jeremy,</hi> when they cryed, Come let us deviſe devices againſt him, and ſmite him with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:175623:35"/> the tongue: <hi>Jeremy</hi> 18.18. by which meanes they digge pits for his ſoule, as there followes, <hi>Verſe</hi> 20. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> likewiſe was caſt into a pit, <hi>Verſe</hi> 22. of the former Chapter: both which were types of Chriſt in this conſpiracy, rayſed againſt him by the <hi>Jewes</hi> his kinſmen, according to the fleſh, at this time.</p>
               <p>But they were beſt to take heed that they fall not into the pit themſelves at the laſt, which they thus digge for others. For, <hi>Conſilium malum conſultoribus ſemper peſſimum;</hi> Evill counſell proves alwayes in the end worſt to them that give it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Bleſſed and happy are thoſe men that walke not in ſuch counſels of the wicked, ſaith <hi>David; Pſal.</hi> 1.1. as at which (as one ſaid pleaſantly, and yet properly) the Holy Ghoſt told him, He was not at leiſure to bee preſent: who abſenting himſelfe likewiſe from this Congregation, and conventuall meeting of the high Prieſts, Scribes, and Elders at this time; it cannot properly be called a Councell or lawfull Aſſembly: but <hi>ſtruma tantum Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatis,</hi> as one tearmes it; An ulcerous bunch onely, or ſwelling rayſ'd by the diſorder and diſtemper of the City: which upon the apprehenſion and taking of Chriſt, was ſuddenly in a confuſed manner congregated and gathered together; the moſt part nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowing why, nor wherefore. And thus much be ſpoken of this wicked Councell and Aſſembly it ſelfe. Now let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Acts of Court, and firſt to the examination of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at the Barre.</p>
               <p>You have heard already of his being brought from the houſe of <hi>Annas</hi> to the houſe of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the preſent high Prieſt, and of the great concourſe of all ſorts and degrees of people, to ſee and heare his examination and arraignment. Now therfore in the next place, you are to heare and ſee of what matters and particulars he was there queſtioned and examined; which Saint <hi>John</hi> tels us in the 19. verſe of his former 18. chapter, to be two-fold, ſaying, That the high Prieſt then asked Jeſus of his Diſciples and of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of his Doctrine principally, as may be ſuppoſed; that ſo they might charge him with Hereſie or foule errors, againſt the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church, and ſo have whereof to accuſe and cenſure him in the court ſpiritu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll: and ſecondarily, of his Diſciples; that ſo they might bring him within the compaſſe of ſedition, as a diſturber of the publike peace and quiet of the Common-wealth; and have whereof to condemne him <hi>in foro civili,</hi> or the court civill.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:175623:35"/>
               <p>The ſpecialties of his examination concerning his Doctrine, might happily be theſe, or to the like purpoſe. As firſt, who was his Maſter or Inſtructer in his new Doctrine which he had lately broached and preached to the people? Secondly, why he did ſeek to innovate and alter their long practiſed and accuſtomed rites? and in ſtead thereof, bring in his owne new deviſes, as in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; why did he ſeeke to thruſt out and extinquiſh their old and ancient ceremony of circumciſion, with his owne new-fangled and new-found waters of Baptiſme? Thirdly, why he was ſo cynicall in his life and converſation, and ſo free in his declamations againſt the Phariſees, Scribes, Prieſts, Elders; yea, and even <hi>Herod</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? and why hee alone would ſeeme to be wiſer then all the world beſides? And being but three and thirty yeares of age, why he was ſo bold and ſawcy in ſuch a ſatyricall manner to bite and whip his ſeniors? Fourthly, why he preached in the fields, and in other ſecret and private places? And laſtly, whether hee could teach any thing of which their owne learned Rabbies, the Prieſts and Scribes and Phariſees before named, were ignorant?</p>
               <p>Concerning his diſciples, he might likewiſe be demanded the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them firſt, &amp; why he being a man but of a mean fortune, ſhould take upon him to be better guarded and attended, then others of greater place &amp; calling? yea, <hi>qui ſunt, ubi ſunt, &amp; qua mente eos college<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> as <hi>Theophylact</hi> ſaith, what they were, where they were, whence they were, to what uſe and purpoſe they were? and whether it did not ſavour of ſedition and diſturbance of the State, to leade about ſuch a crew of diſciples &amp; followers after him, without the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and warrant of authority? As alſo in the ſecond place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their ſtrowing him in the ſtreets; why with ſuch pompe, but foure dayes before he entred into the City; the people ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their garmentss and cutting downe branches in his way; and his owne Diſciples putting their owne cloathes upon the beaſt he rode on, and attending on foot in great ſtate behinde him? thirdly, what was become of them, ſince the time of his taking and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion? and whether it were not a token of their guiltineſſe of ſome diſorderous and riotous practiſes, that they ſhould thus fly away from him, and leave him in his diſtreſſe? Laſtly, he might be urged to bewray where they were, out of a pretence of danger to the common-wealth, ſo long as they lay skulking up and downe the City, hiding themſelves in ſecret corners; and therefore it was very fitting they ſhould be rouſed from their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:175623:36"/> ſtarting holes, and brought together with himſelfe their maſter, to publike puniſhment for their diſorders, that ſo at the laſt, the State might be freed from feare of further danger by theſe meanes.</p>
               <p>So that, <hi>Late quaeſitum ac quaeſtum reor,</hi> ſaith mine author, we may eaſily conceive him to be throughly ſifted and examined to the full, of all ſuch circumſtances, whether concerning his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or his Doctrine, as might in any the leaſt degree advance and helpe forward his condemnation. <hi>Sicut,</hi>

                  </q> then Chriſt by <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> of his Religion, Doctrine, Diſciples; their practiſes and pretexts, and laſtly their courſe of life, that ſo by their queſtioning him in many things, they might trip him in ſomething to his deſtruction and confuſion: as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in the former time of his life, are ſaid to queſtion with him, only to tempt him, and trap him in his ſpeech.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Fruſtra jacitur rete ante oculos pennatorum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon:</hi> In vaine is the net ſpread before the eyes of all that hath wings: <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Oculos ad praevidendum, pennas ad praecavendum;</hi> Eyes to fore-ſee the danger, and wings, that is wayes to prevent the danger. For Chriſt was ſo wary in his anſwer, that they could take no juſt hold or advantage againſt him to his prejudice, till himſelfe was willing to afford it: and then it was rather <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalum acceptum,</hi> then <hi>datum</hi> too; An offence not given by him, but taken by them. As they were ſtill ready to ſnatch at all oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities that might but ſeeme to give a colour to his condemnation before the people.</p>
               <p>But though many falſe witneſſes came in to teſtifie againſt him, yet found they none, ſaith Saint <hi>Matthew: Chap.</hi> 26.60. becauſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:175623:36"/> indeed their witneſſes did not agree together, ſaith Saint <hi>Marke; Chap.</hi> 14.56.

For ſome began to ſpit upon him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him; and to ſay unto him, Propheſie unto us who it was that ſmote thee. And the ſervants did ſtrike him with the palmes of their hands, and ſuch like; <hi>Marke</hi> 14.65. and <hi>John</hi> 18.22. And Saint <hi>Luke</hi> addes, That many other things they ſpake blaſphemouſly againſt him: <hi>Luke</hi> 22.65. So that here you ſee then ſeverall and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Acts, not onely of force and violence, but alſo of contempt and diſgrace; ſhamefully and undeſervedly put upon our bleſſed Saviour: As ſpitting upon him, blind-folding him, ſtriking him with their hands and fiſts; and laſtly, jearing and flouting him, by ſaying, Propheſie unto us who it was that ſmote thee. Of the ſtroake with the palme of the hand, or boxe on the eare, I have ſpoken at large already.

               <p>And firſt of their ſpitting in his face; which to doe, was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a matter of great infamy and reproach among the <hi>Jewes;</hi> as is plaine and evidently that place in the booke of <hi>Numbers,</hi> where God ſpeakes unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> concerning his ſiſter <hi>Miriam,</hi> ſaying; If her father had but ſpit in her face, ſhould ſhe not be aſhamed ſeaven

And againe, The woman is allowed to ſpit in the face of that man as in his diſgrace and infamy, that will not raiſe up ſeed by her unto his brother: <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.9. And even among our ſelves in theſe dayes, we account it among the worſt of injuries and affronts to be ſo ſerv'd. And yet our Saviour yee ſee ſuffers it for our ſakes; anſwerable to that in the Prophet, when he ſpeakes, as in his perſon, ſaying, I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting, <hi>Eſay</hi> 50.6. and <hi>Job</hi> likewiſe; They abhorre me, they flee farre from me; and ſpare not to ſpit in my face: <hi>Job</hi> 30.10. O let us behold then with horrour and dread that divine countenance, which is ſo much honoured and adored in Heaven; and the very aſpect whereof cheeres the whole City of God; how for our ſinnes it is defiled and become deformed here on Earth, by the contempt and ſcorne of ſordid and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe miſcreants: yea, ſo farre abaſed and abuſed, as that no place is thought ſo fit and convenient to voide their excrements in, and to receive their filthy drivell, as the face of the Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of mankinde.</p>
               <p>And when they have fulfilled their malitious mindes in thus ſpitting their fill upon them, then ſecondly they blind-fold him; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t audacius &amp; inverecundius eum percutiant,</hi> ſaith one; that ſo they may the more boldly, and without ſhame, ſmite him with their fiſts: or as I ſhould rather thinke with another, They did it, leſt the admirable forme and beauty of his countenance, being too long vexed and beheld amongſt them; ſhould ſo farre at the laſt, mollifie and lenifie the hard hearts of all beholders, as that they ſhould bee moved to mercy, and drawne to take pity, and have compaſſion upon him; even whether they would or no. To prevent which inconvenience, (as they accounted it) <hi>Faciem illam illectricem obnupſere;</hi> They vayled and hood-wink't as it were, that alluring and heart-winning countenance:

               <p>Neither did they onely ſpit on his face and blindfold it, but buffet and beate it too; which is their third indignity; wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now the box on the eare ſpoken of before, was after the firſt ſort: and the buffeting of him and beating here was of the latter. Whereby they made him as it may be imagined, to reele and ſtagger again with the violence of their ſtrokes; and his eies, as it were to ſtartle in his head, and to bleed even through mouth and noſe.</p>
               <p>And then in the fourth and laſt place, they ſcoffe and ſcorne him ſaying, Propheſie or areade unto us, who it was that ſmote thee: yea, and many other things they ſpake blaſphemouſly againſt him; as you heard before out of Saint <hi>Luke cap.</hi> 22. which of all other his injuries and indignities may well be accounted none of the leaſt. Nay, ſome there are, that feare not to affirme, that, <hi>Chriſti illuſio ac ſubſannatio, omnium acerborum prope acerbiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma; etſi fortiter ab illo lata:</hi> This kinde of taunting and piercing of him, howſoever he bore it patiently and manfully, as all the reſt of his afflictions; yet it may reckoned among the greateſt and bittereſt paſſages of his paſſion, becauſe as the Poet ſaith,

Yea, he went ſo low in this kinde, that if we doe but compare his corporall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions with theſe of his contempt and ſcorne, we may worthily make queſtion and doubt, what was the thing which was moſt wonderfull and terrible in his whole Paſſion: <hi>An dolorum acerbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas qua corpus ejus laniatum eſt; an contumeliarum &amp; irrifionum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitas, quibus etiam anima ſauciata eſt:</hi> Whether the bitterneſſe of his tortures and torments, whereby his body was rent and torne; or the indignity of his contumelies and reproaches, wherewith his ſoule alſo was ſore wounded and afflicted. For in this latter, as well as in the former, (yea, much more in this then that) <hi>Longiſſimo intervallo omnes Martyres ſuperavit;</hi> Hee went beyond all the Martyrs in many degrees.

When as at the time of Chriſts ſuffering, there was nothing to be imagined more ignominious and opprobrious, then what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured: <hi>Tam apud ſuos quam exteros,</hi> aſwell amongſt his owne friends and followers, as ſtrangers and thoſe that were without; whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles:</hi> ſo that he might juſtly complaine, as in the Prophet; <hi>Torcular calcavi ſolus,</hi> I have trodden the wine-preſſe alone; and of all the people there was none with me: <hi>Eſay</hi> 63.3.

Surely, as there can be no more horrible and haynous offence imagined, then for reaſonable creatures to proceed ſo farre in irrationality and impiety, as to lay violent and brutiſh hands upon their Creator and their God; as theſe <hi>Jewes</hi> upon <hi>Chriſt:</hi> ſo on the other ſide, nothing can be conceived to be ſo excellent and eminent, as the goodneſſe and charity of that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which is contented to beare the puniſhments, and ſcornes, and ſcoffes of thoſe his creatures, by whom he is ſo aſſayled and aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vilifyed and abuſed; as our Saviour Chriſt of theſe <hi>Jewes.</hi>

And let us beſeech his infinite goodneſſe and mercy, that although hee have permitted and ſuffered himſelfe to be brought to ſuch a low degree of humiliation; as to have his divine and heavenly face to be thus ſullyed and ſoyled, by the foule and filthy, impure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane

               <p>For they firſt ſpit and ſpawle in the face of Chriſt, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file his image and ſimilitude in their owne ſoules, with impure and uncleane luſts and deſires.

And they likewiſe in the third place, which with unhallowed hearts and hands doe offer to receive the moſt holy and ſanctified body and blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thereunto without reverence or ſenſe of piety and true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, before they have throughly cleanſed their ſoules from the ſullage and filth of their ſinnes by hearty ſorrow and unfeined repentance for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They veile and cover the eyes of Chriſt, that doe not readily and willingly lay open their ſinnes before him by confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but extenuate and leſſen their weakeneſſes and imperfections with counterfeit pretexts, and vaine and idle excuſes: as if they could diſſemble and cloake them before the face of Almighty God our heavenly Father. As alſo they that are ſo audacious and daring in their ſinnes, as to commit them with an high hand, without either fear of God, or ſhame of men, <hi>ac ſi non videret Deus,</hi> as if God either could not, or would not, or did not ſee them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They ſpeake ſlanderouſly and ſcandalouſly of Chriſt, which ſpeak irreverently of holy things, or when profeſſing to be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:175623:41"/> religious, yet they ſpeake like worldlings, without either edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or profit to ſuch as heare them.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, they mocke and ſcoffe at Chriſt with ſcorne, and contemne his meſſengers and Miniſters; or indeed any other his poore Saints and Servants whatſoever. For he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me, ſaith he himſelfe; <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. And therefore for concluſion, let us pray, From theſe and ſuch like fearefull ſinnes, as were thus committed by theſe wicked <hi>Jewes,</hi> againſt our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: Good Lord deliver us. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>WHat paſſed upon our bleſſed Saviour in the houſe of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and Eccleſiaſticall Conventicle rather then Councell of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> you heard the laſt day. So that now in the next place we are to ſee how he was handled before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the Temporall Judges: unto whoſe Court and cuſtody he was delivered and turned over after they had wrought their will, and fill of miſchiefe upon him among themſelves: where firſt, we ſhall not doe amiſſe to obſerve, the fulfilling of Chriſts owne propheſie, and fore-telling of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſage himſelfe. For in the 18. of Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell, 31, 32. <hi>verſes,</hi> we finde him thus ſaying unto his Diſciples, Behold we goe up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all things ſhall be fulfilled to the Sonne of man, that are written by the Prophets; For he ſhall be delivered unto the <hi>Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which propheſie, I ſay, is now accompliſhed, in his being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:175623:41"/> over from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the high Prieſt of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogue; unto <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Deputy, or Preſident: who was not onely a <hi>Gentile</hi> himſelfe, but his juriſdiction alſo was from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> and all Nations (except the <hi>Jewes</hi>) were accounted in thoſe dayes. And this was pre-ordained by the fore-determined Counſell of God to be done accordingly, for theſe two ends or reaſons. The firſt, that hee might bee put to death: which by the <hi>Jewes</hi> Law, (as they will ſeeme to affirme) he could not. For themſelves tell <hi>Pilate,</hi> in the very next words after our Text; That it is not lawfull for them to put any man to death: <hi>Verſe</hi> 31. The ſecond, for the manner of his death; that he might be crucified. For ſo is it farther ſpecified in the 32. <hi>verſe: (viz)</hi> That it was done, that the ſaying of Jeſus might be fulfilled, which he ſpake, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye: which is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be crucifying, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.9. To which place this paſſage in Saint <hi>John</hi> doth allude.</p>
               <p>Now the fulfilling of this propheſie of Chriſts owne ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelfe, ſhall afford us onely this Vſe at this time; becauſe as I told you at the beginning, I muſt point and paſſe; my diſcourſe upon this ſubject increaſing to a bigger bulke then I aymed at, or intended at the firſt: To let us ſee and know, That there was not the leaſt circumſtance of his paſſion, which hee did not fore-ſee, and fore-tell himſelfe; ſo that none of theſe things came unwittingly or unwillingly upon him, or by chance, as upon a meere man: but all by the fore-determined Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God, as I ſay, and his owne conſent. And therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo much fore-knowledge of his owne afflictions, hee might have avoyded and ſhunned them many wayes, if he would: but to let us underſtand the greatneſſe of his love unto us; he would not refuſe any torture or any trouble to doe us good: but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and readily performe all things requiſite for our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; giving his ſoule as an offering for our ſinnes, as the Prophet fore-told: <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.10. So that without any tergiverſation, or regret, he ſuffered himſelfe freely to be preſented before <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate,</hi> and the judgement ſeat of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> although he knew that he went but to his owne death and condemnation; as <hi>Pilate</hi> told him; That hee had power to crucifie him or to looſe him: <hi>John</hi> 19.10. unto whom notwithſtanding Chriſt gave this anſwer: <hi>(viz.)</hi> That hee could have had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er againſt him, except it had beene given him from above:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:175623:42"/> 
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. of the ſame Chapter; that is, from the Court and Councell of Heaven; of which himſelfe was a principall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may conſider alſo a little of the ſeaſon, which they tooke to carry Chriſt unto <hi>Pilate</hi> in; which is expreſſed to be the morning: or as our text ſaith, while it was early. So that, as it ſhould ſeeme, when the fatall night was once over, they neglected no time; but made haſte to ſhed his innocent bloud, and to deliver him over unto the ſword, not of juſtice, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, as it is evident and apparent enough to all the world; even to the very Judges themſelves, as will be ſhewne hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>David</hi> in one place ſaith, That howſoever heavineſſe or ſorrow may endure for a night; yet joy commeth in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: <hi>(viz.) Pſal.</hi> 30.5. when as our bleſſed Saviour here can finde none of this joy, neither morning nor evening; but after a diſmall night, as you heard before, meets with as darke a day: where we may obſerve, that Chriſt our Lord ſuffered ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and indignities or others for our ſakes, at all times and houres, both of night and day. Firſt, from the evening (which was the time of his appprehenſion) till the morning, as you have heard already; and now againe from the very morning till the evening, as here followes: <hi>Tota nocte vexatus, &amp; tota die ſine intermiſſione cruciatus,</hi> ſaith one; Vexed all the night, and tortured all the day without ceaſing or intermiſſion. For at the firſt houre hee is carryed to the Judge, and before him accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; at the ſecond, examined; at the third, condemned; at the fourth, hee was ſcourged and crowned with Thornes; at the fift, hee had the heavy burthen of his owne Croſſe laid upon his ſhoulders; at the ſixt, he was crucified; at the ſeaventh, the Souldiers caſt lots upon his garment; at the eighth, hee had Vinegar given him to drinke; at the ninth, he dyed; at the tenth, he had a ſpeare thruſt through his ſide, whereout came water and bloud: and at the evening, or toward the latter end of the day, he was buried.</p>
               <p>O ſweet Jeſus, there was ſome great cauſe ſurely why thou wouldeſt at every new houre, thus ſuffer new puniſhments and afflictions for our ſinnes: and it can be no other but this, becauſe we doe every day of the yeare, and every houre of the day; yea every minute and moment of every houre of each ſeverall night and day, provoke thy heavenly father to wrath in one kinde or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:175623:42"/> other; by new tranſgreſſions and delinquencies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that thou mighteſt ſatisfie and appeaſe the ſaid wrath of his, as well for the circumſtances as the ſubſtance of our ſins, thou wouldſt be puniſhed for them at all times, aſwell at mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening, as at noone day. It is but meet and right then, that as thou ſufferedſt continually from one end of the day unto the other: ſo on the other ſide, that wee ſhould pray continually, as the Apoſtle exhorteth; and ſing prayſes unto thee, both night and day without ceaſing, for ſo great a benefit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let us obſerve, that though theſe <hi>Jewes</hi> ſent Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the judgement Hall of <hi>Pilate,</hi> yet they went not in themſelves: Their reaſon being this, leſt they ſhould be defiled; but that they might eate the Paſſeover, as our text ſaith: Becauſe, as it ſhould ſeeme, it was accounted an unlawfull and an unholy thing for a <hi>Jew</hi> at the time of that high and ſolemne Feaſt, to enter into the houſes or ſocieties of any of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> which were eſteemed no otherwiſe then as uncleane among them. But hereupon Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> cryes out, <hi>O Impia &amp; ſtulta caecitas!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tract. <hi>114.</hi> in Iohan.</note> 
                  <hi>habitaculo videlicet contaminarentur alieno, &amp; non contaminarentur ſcelero proprio:</hi> O impious and fooliſh blindneſſe, to thinke that they could be more defiled by the habitation and externall ſociety of ſtrangers, then by their owne proper and internall ſinnes. <hi>Alienigenae Judicis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio contaminari timebant, &amp; fratris innocentis ſanguinem fundere non timebant:</hi> They were afraid to be contaminated by the judgement Hall of the <hi>Roman</hi> Preſident; yet feared not to ſhed the bloud of their owne innocent and undefiled brother: which is the right property of all hypocrites, to ſtraine at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camell; to thinke it a more haynous thing, <hi>Pulicem quam homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem occidere,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaketh; To kill a flea at one time, then a man at another; To be over-curious and ceremonious, yea, and in very deed ſuperſtitious too about ſmall matters; and yet to let the weightier matters of the Law alone: as mercy and judgement, and fidelity, and the love of God, and the like: for which neglect, our Saviour himſelfe condemneth the <hi>Phariſees, Matth.</hi> 23.23. and <hi>Luke</hi> 11.43.</p>
               <p>But howſoever it be, theſe <hi>Jewes</hi> that they may ſeeme right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eate the Paſſeover, do pretend to keepe themſelves pure and clean from all forraine defilements; <hi>Caeterum immunditiem includunt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:175623:43"/> praetorii parietibus;</hi> when as yet they confine this defilement onely to the walls of <hi>Palats</hi> hall or houſe of judgement: not doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing otherwiſe in the publike face as well of Earth as Heaven, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the innocent over unto death and damnation. But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelfe tells them, that knew beſt how to define de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement, That ſuch murthers and evill thoughts and falſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and ſlanders and the like, which they practiſe here againſt him: Theſe are the things which defile the man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19.20. Laſtly, they doe honour the figurative paſſeover with a deceivea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fained reverence, when as they offer violence with their bloody and ſacrilegious hands unto the true paſſeover, indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring as much as in them lies, utterly to overthrow him, even with an eternall deſtruction. But I muſt not dwell here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilate</hi> therefore in the next place, went out unto them, and ſaid; <hi>What accuſation bring you againſt this man?</hi> Where let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That although this Gentile bore no great affection to that Religion which the Jewes at this time profeſſed, but rather diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded it; yea, ſlighted and laughed at it in his minde: Yet in his firſt hearing of the cauſe, he diſcharges the part of an upright and juſt Judge amongſt them, in bidding them to ſhew what accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they brought againſt the priſoner, whom with ſuch tumult and clamour they had brought bound unto him. As if he ſhould ſay thus: Whereas you Jewes have brought here one of your owne Nation to be ſentenced to death by me; I tell you, I cannot, I muſt not, I will not, I dare not doe it, except you can ſhew me ſome juſt and lawfull cauſe why I ſhould. For, <hi>ſi accuſaſſa ſufficit, quis innocens?</hi> if to accuſe alone were ſufficient, who ſhould be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent? Neither is it the manner of the Romans to put any man to death, unleſſe he be firſt convicted and found guilty of ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and haynous, yea, capitall offence againſt their owne Lawes. For, as for your ſuperſtitious ceremonies, of violating your Sabbaths, eating of Swines fleſh, ſpeaking againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, the Temple, or your God, I have nothing to doe with them: <hi>Ad meum Tribunal non pertinent,</hi> They come not within the compaſſe of my Inquiry. And therefore bring him not to me, but take him and judge him according to your owne Law, <hi>verſe</hi> 31. of this Chapter. <hi>Aurea planè</hi> Pilati <hi>exordia,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>utinam par epilogus, Pilate</hi> begins well, and it were well for him, if his end were anſwerable.</p>
               <p>But they for reply and anſwer hereunto, cry out and ſay, <hi>If
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:175623:43"/> he were not a malefactour, we would not have delivered him unto thee;</hi> as if they were angry with <hi>Pilate,</hi> becauſe he would not reſt ſatisfied with their examination and tryall of him, without any more adoe: as if hee were bound to ſtand to their prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and unjuſt ſentence, and ſo become an inſtrument onely of their malice; to execute whomſoever, and whatſoever, they, with the conſent of their arrogant and malitious high Prieſts, ſhould determine and decree. Where we may behold (as <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerveth) the inſolency of thoſe men, that without the feare of God, are lifted up to great dignities, and high places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the world; be they Eccleſiaſtical or Civill, whether in Church or Common-wealth: who being blinded with the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of their power and eminency, thinke it lawfull for them to perpetrate and commit any injuſtice or iniquity whatſoever, without controule. As theſe take it as a check to their pride and greatneſſe, that Chriſt is not by <hi>Pilate</hi> accounted a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, onely becauſe they accuſe him: <hi>If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him unto thee.</hi> But O ingratefull and unhappy <hi>Jewes!</hi> let us heare ſome relation from you, of the evils which this your <hi>Meſſias</hi> hath done; and the injuries and violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he hath offered unto you: for which you thus call and count him a malefactor, and thinke him worthy of death. Are they any other, if you rightly examine them, and your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, then preaching the wordes of life unto you? then healing all manner of your diſeaſes, by reſtoring ſight to the blinde, hearing to the deafe, ſpeaking to the dumbe, going to the lame, and life to the dead?

               <p>Which if it be ſo, why then ſurely we can never ſufficiently magnify and extoll this his great goodneſſe, and inutterable love and charity towards us; thus to cloathe himſelfe with the rags of our wickedneſſe, that ſo he might inveſt and adorne us with the robes of his owne righteouſneſſe: to expoſe themſelves to the danger of the Lawes curſe, to make us heires of the eternall and everlaſting bleſſing: inſomuch as he cryes out unto his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father in the Prophet, Thine indignation lyeth hard upon mee, and thou haſt vexed mee with all thy ſtormes: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.7. becauſe indeed the juſt wrath of his eternall father, and other puniſhments due onely to us for our ſinnes; hee would they ſhould bee laid upon his owne ſhoulders: and therefore is hee ſilent and ſtands mute before the Judge, when they cry out againſt

               <p>For, for the firſt, Chriſt was ſo far from ſtirring up ſeditions, or rayſing tumults and diſſentions among the people; as that on the other ſide, he ſtrived and indeavoured what hee might, to congregate and gather them together in one; even as the Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, as he profeſſeth himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>And thus you ſee the truth of that which <hi>Solomon</hi> delivered long ſince: How that a man that beareth falſe witneſſe againſt his neighbour, is like an hammer, and a ſword, and a ſharpe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.18. which are three inſtruments many times of much hurt; as of breaking in peeces, cutting aſunder, penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and piercing deepe, yea even to the very bowels and inward parts: ſo that nothing is more pernitious then a falſe witneſſe, which wounds a man, not onely in his fortunes and his honour, but often in his life too; as theſe <hi>Jewes</hi> did Chriſt. Yea, lying lips, and a deceitfull tongue, as <hi>David</hi> likewiſe ſaith; are as the ſharpe arrowes of the mighty man, and as the coales of Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120 4. Whereby he ſheweth (as our marginall notes expreſſe) that there is nothing ſo ſharpe to pierce, nor ſo hot to ſet on fire, as the ſlanderous tongue; with which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our bleſſed Saviour, as you have heard, was much afflicted both in his life and death. But as his owne glory and our good is much increaſed by his patient bearing it; ſo their ſinnes and puniſhments are, and ſhall be much the greater that did it: as alſo ſhall bee all theirs that fall into the like foule tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards their neighbours. And therefore for concluſion of this circumſtance, let me uſe onely the Wiſe mans exhortation
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:175623:46"/> at this time: Refraine thy tongue from ſlander, for there is no word ſo ſecret that ſhall goe for nought; and the mouth that ſpeaketh lyes, ſlayeth the ſoule: <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 1.11.

               <p>But in the next place, <hi>Pilate</hi> perceiving by ſome paſſages and carriages of the buſineſſe, that it was for envy onely that the <hi>Jewes</hi> did thus perſecute and proſecute <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and bring him unto him: He therefore endeavours by three ſeverall wayes and meanes, if it be poſſible; to deliver him out of their hands, and to ſave his life: As firſt, by turning him over to <hi>Herod:</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by ballancing him with <hi>Barabbas:</hi> and laſtly, by ſcourging and crowning him with Thornes.</p>

               <p>Let us here then a little contemplate and admire the perverſe and erroneous judgement and cenſure of the world; That, that eternall word of God, and uncreated wiſedome of the Father; which at the firſt made, and ſtill preſerveth this whole univerſe in which we all live, move, and have our being: yea he, in whom are hid all the treaſuſes of wiſedome and knowledge, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.3. ſhould yet by <hi>Herod</hi> and his Courtiers, be reckoned, arrayed, and derided as a foole.</p>
               <p>If this be not an unheard of example, as of humility in him, ſo of fooliſhneſſe and madneſſe in them; let the truly wiſe of the world (if any ſuch there be) Judge. O ſweet Jeſus, who, or what hath led and directed thee to this height and degree of folly; as for us that are fooles and madde men indeed, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come willing to be accounted a foole thy ſelfe?

And then though the world deride and ſcorne him, laugh and jeare, flout and point at him; yea, begge him for a foole: yet let it not trouble nor grieve him, but let him rejoyce rather, in that hee is thought fit to be accounted a foole for Chriſts ſake; and to bee made conformable in ſome things to the Image and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of his bleſſed Saviour, the Sonne of God: who was not onely counted, but clad as a foole too, as you have heard already. For they put upon him a white garment, as ſaith the <hi>Geneva</hi> and vulgar <hi>Latine;</hi> or a gay and gorgeous roabe, as our laſt tranſlation reades it: <hi>Luke</hi> 23.11. not as a roabe of honour or excellency, but of infamy and diſgrace; as all Expoſitours conclude upon the place.</p>
               <p>Which may afford us alſo this ſecond Vſe; That though our attire and habite be not alwayes ſo coſtly and comely, as that of our neighbours; yet, that wee be not dejected nor caſt downe therewith, ſeeing Chriſt for our ſakes refuſed not to weare ſuch a ſcornefull and contemptuous garment, as his very adverſaries were pleaſed to put upon him. Neither let us judge of men and their worth, onely by their out-ſide; ſince,
<q>Saepe ſub attrita latitat Sapientia veſte:</q> Wiſedome may bee, and often is clad but in a Fooles Coate. As likewiſe,
<q>Vilis ſaepe cadus nobile Nectar habet:</q> Beggerly bottles oftentimes hold rich Wines.

As on the other ſide, <hi>Virum non à ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimentis, immo nec ab ipſo corpore; ſed ab anima laudare decet &amp; admirari:</hi> Man ought not to be honoured and admired ſo much for the outward garments of his body; nor yet for his body it ſelfe: neither (ſeeme it never ſo comely and hanſome in our eyes) as for the inward graces and endowments of his ſoule: For what profit is there of all outward ornaments or preſence; <hi>Cum anima mendico ſit omni miſerius induta?</hi> (as our <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> goes on) When our ſoule is more miſerably clad then the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt beggar? as being wretched, and miſerable, and poore, and blinde, and naked; as is ſaid of the Church of <hi>Laodicea: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p>There might be many more Vſes made of Chriſt his being poſted and hurryed too and agen, from one Judges houſe and authority to another: as firſt, carryed to <hi>Annas;</hi> from him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to <hi>Caiaphas;</hi> from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> thirdly, to <hi>Pilate;</hi> and from him to <hi>Herod:</hi> and laſtly, from <hi>Herod</hi> backe againe to <hi>Pilate.</hi> As alſo of the ſcorne and contempt that was put upon him by the rude and raskall multitude, in all theſe his ſeverall paſſages too and fro, from one place unto another: men, women, and children, of all rankes and conditions following him; with howting, and ſhowting at him, as is uſuall in ſuch caſes; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when hee was arrayed in that ſcornefull and diſgracefull habite, ſpoken of laſt before: and ſo carried through the more publike and eminent ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for the nonce; and of purpoſe onely, to have him gaz'd upon as an Owle, and bayted as a Beare: when, if ever any man, then he much more, might juſtly complaine, as in the Prophet: <hi>Factus ſum in deriſum omni populo, &amp; canticum eorum tota die;</hi> I am become a ſcorne to all people, and their ſong all the day long: <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.14.

               <p>THeſe words (beloved) are ſpoken by <hi>Pilate</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Preſident, unto the <hi>Jewes</hi> that were Chriſts accuſers, and very urgent with him to have him crucified: who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew that for envy they had delivered him unto him, as it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.18. Therefore he endeavours, as I told you the laſt day, by three ſeverall wayes and meanes, if it be poſſible, to ſave his life, and to deliver him out of their hands. Firſt, by turning him over to <hi>Herod:</hi> Secondly, by ballancing him with <hi>Barabbas:</hi> And laſtly, by ſcourging and crowning him with Thornes: Whereas therefore he had prevayled nothing by the firſt meanes, <hi>(viz.)</hi> by ſending him to <hi>Herod;</hi> as you heard then alſo at large related and dilated unto you: Therefore in theſe words, as you ſee, He makes tryall of the ſecond, by propounding unto them whether they would have <hi>Barabbas</hi> or <hi>Jeſus</hi> let looſe at this their great &amp; ſolemne Feaſt of the Paſſeover. For ſo ſaith the text, Will you that I releaſe unto you the King of the <hi>Jewes?</hi> or as it is in S. <hi>Matthewes</hi> Goſpell: Whom will ye that I releaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; <hi>Barabbas,</hi> or <hi>Jeſus</hi> that is called <hi>Chriſt? Matth.</hi> 27.17.</p>
               <p>O ſweet <hi>Jeſus!</hi> now or never there is hope and comfort neare; that after thy many tortures and troubles formerly recounted, which thou haſt ſo quietly and patiently put up and borne at the hands of thy malitious and unkinde Country-men; yea, Kinſmen according to the fleſh: Thy life notwithſtanding ſhall be ſpared, and thy perſon ſet free and at liberty again at the laſt.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:175623:49"/> For, whereas he hath beene a Theefe, and taken away by violence the bread of the poore and needy; Why, thou haſt beene a feeder of them, and a ſupplyer of their wants and neceſſities upon all occaſions? whereas he hath beene a Cutter and Robber on the high-wayes, and by that meanes wounded and mangled the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſengers, travelling as it were, betweene <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo:</hi> Why, thou as the good <hi>Samaritane,</hi> haſt healed them again, by binding up their wounds, and powring in Wine and Oyle unto them: whereas he hath beene a Murtherer, (as <hi>Marke</hi> 15.7.) and ſlain the living; Why, thou haſt beene a reviver and reſtorer of life unto them that have beene dead. All theſe therefore, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more, unto which thou haſt beene helpfull and beneficiall in one kinde or other, will call and cry out aloud, Set free and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty unto us, not <hi>Barabbas</hi> our cruell enemy; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> our cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous friend: yea, our kinde and common benefactour.</p>
               <p>For it is impoſſible, even in the judgement of <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelfe, that any ſhould be ſo ungratefull as to doe the contrary; which occaſioned him to make tender of the moſt notorious delinquent that was then in durance amongſt them, to be in competition with Chriſt; that ſo he might be ſure (as he upon good ground and reaſon, conceived and imagined) not to faile of the freedome and releaſe of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> And yet for all this, They cry out amaine, with one voyce and unanimous conſent; Not this man but <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas:</hi> as yee ſee in the text.</p>

               <p>In regard whereof in the ſecond place, he is ſtiled by others: The Lords lot, choſen by <hi>Aarons</hi> ſucceſſour (though much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated) the high Prieſt, to be offered for a ſinne-offering; as was appointed by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; where if we take the paines to ſearch, we ſhall find: as two ſparrowes ſpoken of before in <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. So two Goates, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. preſentable before the Lord at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one ſhould be for a ſcape-goate; and the other for an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord, as it is there ſaid. By which ſome of the Ancients (as B. <hi>Bilſon</hi> tels me) underſtood Jeſus and <hi>Barabbas:</hi> Jeſus to be ſlaine as an offering to the Lord, and <hi>Barabbas</hi> to be ſent to the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:175623:50"/> Jewes deſart or wilderneſſe, bearing the ſinnes of the people that cryed, Let him be crucified, let him be crucified.</p>
               <p>Which if it be ſo, then once more, nay evermore, let us medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of the mercy and love of Chriſt towards us: and muſe upon his lowlineſſe and humility, that was content not onely to take our nature upon him and therein to ſuffer death upon the Croſſe for our ſinnes; and ſo, as I have ſayd, to become our ſin-offering: but alſo to be compared with the greateſt malefactour of thoſe times. And by publike ſentence, yea votes and voyces of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be pronounced a greater delinquent and more worthy of death then he. And let us beſeech his infinite goodneſſe, by that great dejection and ſubmiſſion of his, whereby he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented thus to be rejected by theſe Jewes; neither did diſdaine to be adjudged worthy of death, and to have <hi>Barabbas</hi> a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed robber to be preferred to life before him: that he would give us ſuch grace; that by how much we are inferiour unto himſelfe, by ſo much he would inflame our deſires the more ardently to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bear the contempt and rejection of this World, and as caſt downe through the ſenſe of our ſins and infirmities, and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes every way; account no otherwiſe of our ſelves then as of the ſcorn &amp; ſcum thereof, the baſeſt &amp; meaneſt among the ſons of men.

               </p>
               <p>Why ſhould man have any high thoughts, or be proud in any thing; whoſe very conception is ſinneful, his birth paineful, his life laborious, and his death unavoydable? As alſo in the ſecond place, let us continually pray unto him, that he would not permit and ſuffer us for any reſpect whatſoever, whether of feare or favor to forſake our obedience and reſpect towards him; but ſtill prefer his honor and worſhip, and love, and friendſhip before all earthly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages whatſoever; yea, and before our lives too.</p>
               <p>And for further uſe &amp; application, let us be content with patience and ſilence to bear it, if at any time we ſee the wicked &amp; lewd, and thoſe that we know to be worſe then our ſelves, to be prefer'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, either to the honours, or in the favors of the world, ſeeing Chriſt was contented to let ſinfull and wicked <hi>Barabbas</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before him in theſe Jewes eſteeme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let us take heed of preferring vice before vertue; the fleſh before the ſpirit; the honours, and profits, and pleaſures of the world, before the honour, and worſhip, and ſervice of God:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:175623:51"/> for in doing all or any of theſe, we doe but preferre <hi>Barabbas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Neither let us upon any occaſion connive and give way to any unbeſeeming or unfitting practiſes and imperfections contrary to our owne conſciences; either to pleaſe our ſelves, or for feare to diſpleaſe others; leſt we be like <hi>Pilate,</hi> who becauſe he would not offend and diſpleaſe the <hi>Jewes,</hi> he appointed <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be ſcourged, and <hi>Barabbas</hi> to be looſed. Nor yet farther let us upon any termes whatſoever, be we Magiſtrates or inferiours, juſtifie the wicked, and condemne the innocent: for in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we do juſtifie <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and condemne <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And for the laſt uſe, let us all know, that how often ſoever it pleaſeth God to put good motions into our mindes, of ſetting <hi>Chriſt</hi> at liberty; either in his poore members that are in durance, or in any other preſſures and oppreſſions whatſoever; or in our owne ſoules, where hee is impriſoned by our ſinnes: and wee neglect the opportunity, either through ſome pretended difficulty; or remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and weakeneſſe of our owne reſolutions and reſiſtance: in both theſe caſes, and diverſe others like theſe: we cry with theſe <hi>Jewes, Vivat Barabbas, &amp; crucifigatur Chriſtus;</hi> Let <hi>Barabbas</hi> live, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> be crucified: which how fearefull a ſinne it is, you have heard before.

And therefore for this purpoſe, he determined to lay ſo ſharpe a puniſhment upon him, as might ſuffice (as hee had reaſon to thinke) to aſſwage their fury; and ſatisfie their bloudy and cruell deſires.

And yet our great Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt ye ſee, doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to undergoe it for our ſakes, that ſo he might beare in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thoſe wounds and ſtripes that we have deſerved by our ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as alſo that thereby he might animate and encourage his Martyrs and Confeſſours unto patience and conſtancy in their like indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and diſgraces, which he knew the World in ſucceeding ages would put upon them for his names ſake.</p>
               <p>Neither was this kind of puniſhment and affliction of his, only infamous and opprobrious; but terrible and tormenting too. For the ſouldiers and other executioners of it having once their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant confirmed by authority from <hi>Pilate</hi> for doing it, did preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrippe him of his garments, and faſten him to a poſte or pillar (as it ſhould ſeeme by many writers the manner was) and then charge and diſcharge upon him ſuch bloody blowes: as if he had been both the greateſt offendor and the baſeſt ſlave in the World. And that not with a ſingle ſcourge or rod alone; but with ſeverall and ſundry kinds of them; if we may take the word and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of ſome Antiquity.

               <p>But this yet is not ſufficient to ſatisfie the malicious mindes of theſe, not men, but monſters of cruelty and impiety. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the ſoldiers had thus ſcourged him: They brought him into the Pretorie or common-hall once more, and there againe they ſtrip him, and put upon him a purple robe: and preſſed upon his head (which you know is a very ſenſible and tender part, and which before had ſcap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By all which actions it appeareth; that they were as much, if not more deſirous to take away his reputation as his life. For they ſought but onely the ordinary torment of the croſſe, by which to take away his life: but to take away his reputation, they ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all theſe; and many more ſtrange inventions equally compoſed of torment and ſhame; wherein crueltie ſeem'd pleaſant, and mirth full of malice (as it is well obſerved by Doctor <hi>Heyward:</hi>) out of whoſe Threatiſe, called <hi>The Sanctuary of a troubled ſoule,</hi> give me leave, with your patience, (onely for haſte to finiſh this point,) to inſert here a few lines, well fitted there by his devout heart and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hand, to my preſent purpoſe. They ſhall not be many, neither wholly his; but interlaced ſometimes with other notes and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, as well of mine owne as other mens.</p>
               <p>The very heathen (ſaith he) for the moſt part, in their executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of juſtice, did obſerve this rule; to doe it with all outward gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and griefe, and not with any light, either geſtures or jeſts; whereby they might be ſuſpected of taking pleaſure in taking puniſhment, nor with any extraordinary ſeverity (excepting ſome few Tyrants) which might make a ſhew of private revenge. But (as he goes on) it was not ſufficient for theſe ſavages to crucifie Chriſt; except they did it both with deriſion and deſpight. Their mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious mindes muſt of neceſſity be ſatisfied, as well with his ſhame as with his blood: and that after an unuſuall manner. For when was purple before that time uſed for diſhonour? And who ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that day had beene crowned with thornes? The purple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched but to a ſcorne; but the thornes went further: For looke how many thornes did pierce his fleſh, ſo many ſtreames of blood could not chooſe but iſſue from him; ſo that, as another ſaith:

                  <hi>Purpuratus jam Chriſtus totus, intus ac foris; corpore ſanguinolento &amp; veſte purpurea.</hi> Chriſt is become purple all over, as well within as without; having a deepe died ſanguine body, as well as a purple garment. But it was not by chance and at adventure, that hee was clothed in purple, and therein mocked; but as the holy Ghoſt made <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to ſay, <hi>It is expedient that one ſhould dye for the people.</hi> John. 11.50. and likewiſe <hi>Pilate; What I have written, I have written,</hi> Joh. 19.22. So it made the ſouldiers, to ſcorne him in a purple garment, in token that whatſover they did to his reproach, ſhould follow afterward to his greater honour and renowne. For <hi>Livy</hi> tells us, that <hi>Romae, veſtis longa &amp; purpurea, Imperatorum &amp; Triumphantium.</hi> i. e. At Rome, a long purple garment was the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite of the Emperors, and ſuch as had triumphed after ſome great victories and conqueſts: And not onely at Rome, but <hi>ubique ea in pretio fuit,</hi> ſaith another author, it was in high eſteeme alſo in other places; which doth evidently appeare to be ſo by ſundry paſſages in ſacred hiſtory: For the curtaines and hangings of the Tabernacle, were appointed by God himſelfe to be of purple, as yee may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26.1.36. verſes.

So that being inſatiable in their cruelty toward him; they importune him, ſome with perſwaſions; and others with confuſed clamours and cryes that hee might bee crucified.

And no death neither, but that of the Croſſe will ſatisfy their deſires: and that makes them cry ſo often and ſo loud, Let him bee crucified, let him be crucified. O the inconſtancy and impiety of an inſolent and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny headed multitude! What a miſerable caſe are they in, that muſt bee tried and judged by thee? which art content with theſe <hi>Jewes</hi> to honour Chriſt and his Miniſters one day with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

               <p>But neither are they culpable of inconſtancy alone; but of impiety too; and that in the higheſt degree. For what inſolences and outrages will they not perpetrate and commit, if they bee fruſtrated and croſſed never ſo little in their wayes and wills? The very Sonne of God himſelfe and Saviour of the World (and therefore much leſſe his Miniſters) being not able to ſcape ſcot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free; if hee come once within their clutches, or within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of their cuſtody and command, which gave occaſion to the Holy Ghoſt to preſcribe that caveat to theſe people of the <hi>Jewes</hi> long ſince, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould not follow a multitude to doe evill; <hi>neque in judicio plurimorum acquieſces ſententiae; ut à vero devies,</hi> as the vulgar Latine reades it, neither in judgement ſhalt thou reſt or rely upon the ſentence of many to decline from truth. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.2. And yet for all this warning ſo long before hand; they and their Judges too, ſplit themſelves upon the ſame Rock at this time. For <hi>Pilate,</hi> although before he had openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both that Chriſt was innocent, and that hee had authority to quit him: yet giving place either to the favour or fury of this multitude of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> rather then to juſtice, hee pronounced ſentence of death againſt him; and delivered him to the pleaſure of his enemies, to doe with him even what they would, as you may ſee. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.25. By which it appeares plainly, that <hi>Vox populi</hi> is not alwayes <hi>Vox Dei;</hi> the voyce of the people is not alwayes the voyce of God.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:175623:57"/> howſoever the <hi>Iewes</hi> made choyce of this death for him out of the depth of their malice, and venimous hatred againſt him: hoping thereby not only to deſtroy his body, but his ſoule too, yet hee (that was able to worke good out of evill, and turne their miſchiefe and malice owards him, to his owne glory and the benefit of his Church and choſen) had other reaſons in the ſecret of his owne counſell, which they little dream't of, why hee would undergoe it, and take it upon him.</p>
               <p>As firſt that the curſe might be imputed unto him, which was due to us: and ſo we by his curſe might be redeemed from the curſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> as the former Apoſtle ſaith wee are in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place. And therefore ſayth <hi>Aretius: Ideo cruce paſſus eſt Chriſtus, ut omnis maledictio, etiam à forma ſupplicii in illo concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reret.</hi> Therefore did Chriſt ſuffer on the Croſſe, that by the forme and manner of his ſuffering, every curſe might concurre and be found in him, which was due to us, yea hee himſelfe bare our ſinnes in his body on the Tree, that wee might bee delivered from ſin and be healed by his ſtripes, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Theophilact</hi> aſſigne it, <hi>ut ipſius aeris naturam mundaret, &amp; terram ſanctificaret ſanguinis ſuae diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione,</hi> that he might cleanſe and perfume the ayre with his holy and Heavenly breath, and ſanctifie and hallow the Earth with the ſtreames of his ſacred blood, diſtilling and deſcending down from his bleſſed body. <hi>Medicina enim quae removet maledictionem terrae, eſt ſanguis Chriſti,</hi> For the onely Medicine that is able to remoove the curſe of the earth is the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſaith, That hanging in the ayre on the Croſſe, the foote whereof was faſtned in the Earth, and the top looking towards Heaven, hee might ſhew himſelfe to be the true Mediator betwixt God and man; by reconciling Heaven and Earth together, and reducing our humane nature to the ſociety of Angells, and ſo making a perfect peace and union betwixt the things above and the things below.</p>
               <p>By ſuch ſtrange and contrary meanes doth God ſhew his power and providence in working our ſalvation and redemption, giving us life even by his owne death, and that the moſt accurſed death too, even the death of the Croſſe. <hi>Optimum faciens inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum vitae quod erat mortis peſſimum genus,</hi> as one ſaith; making that the beſt inſtrument of life, which was the worſt kinde of death; worſt indeed, as we ſhall eaſily perceive, if wee will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:175623:58"/> to looke another while into the manner of it, together with the counſell and cruelty of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in inflicting it, as wee have already done into the mercy and goodneſſe of Chriſt in ſuffering it. For beſides the infamy and ignominy of it, as you have heard already; it was a terrible and bitter death too: where hee felt the uttermoſt of thoſe paines, which incenſed and inraged malice was able to inflict, and mans nature able to indure.</p>
               <p>For the better and more cleare expreſſion whereof, it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſome, that Chriſts Paſſion on the Croſſe, had in it all the foure dimenſions, as length, breadth, height, depth. Lenght firſt, in regard that the Croſſe was a lingring ſlow death; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi diù vive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur, &amp; mors ipſa protendebatur; ne dolor citius finiretur:</hi> which gave no quick diſpatch unto the patient, but protracted and prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his life, keeping him a great while together upon the Racke under the ſharpe ſenſe aſwell of our ſinnes as his owne paines. Now it is truly ſayd, that <hi>Acerbiſſima eſt mors quae trahit poenam;</hi> it is the bittereſt kinde of death, wherein the paines thereof are long continued and delayed, and not preſently or ſuddenly fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and diſpatched. For to have death prolonged when a man is under the ſtroke of death; is to die many deaths at once. Now it was full three houres betwixt Chriſts affixion to the Croſſe, and his expiration on the Croſſe. For hee continued there from the ſixth houre untill the ninth, as the Evangeliſts declare. Let a Poet then make the application.</p>

The ſixth and laſt, the blaſphemous and contumelious words; which the Phariſees, Scribes and Prieſts breathed out againſt him, which is more pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to an ingenuous and noble nature than any corporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatſoever (as I have in part ſhewed you before:) And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof it is ſaid of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great; that he forgave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſharpe ſwords, but never any ſharpe words.</p>
               <p>But the length and bredth of our Saviours croſſe is not greater than the heighth and depth of it. That paſſion may be ſaid to be deepeſt which ſurpaſſeth other paſſions in the ſharpneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiveneſſe thereof. Now, that our Saviours paſſion did ſo, it will eaſily appeare by this firſt: That it did not ſurprize him ſuddenly, but was long before fore-ſeene and expected of him. For if you ſearch the Evangeliſts, you ſhal find his arraignment and death of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated from his owne mouth, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.22. and againe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.17. as alſo <hi>Luke</hi> 9.44. And in the 18. of the ſame Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; He reckons up all the particulars, as his delivering to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, mocking, reviling, ſpitting upon, ſcourging, putting to death, and the like, as you have heard before. Now, as long as he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw he ſuffered: For the expectation of evill is not leſſe than the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:175623:59"/> ſenſe: but as to looke long for a good thing is a puniſhment; ſo for evill is a torment. And as for thoſe proverbs, or ſayings; <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectatio minuit dolorem;</hi> expectation doth diminiſh and leſſen griefe: and <hi>Iacula praeviſa minus feriunt:</hi> darts fore-ſeene doe wound the leſſe. They are true, of ſuch evills as may be avoyded and averted, either in whole, or in part. But not of thoſe which cannot be eſchewed by the utmoſt of our Art and induſtry. For, for a man to be blaſted with a flaſh of lightning, or ſmitten with a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derclap; troubles him leſſe to take him on the ſudden when hee thinkes not of it; then, if it were told him before, that at ſuch an houre he ſhould periſh by ſuch a means; for this lingring expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, doth poſſeſſe the ſoule continually with horror and ſad affrights.</p>
               <p>Adde to this, as adding more meaſure unto this; That the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt was of a moſt perfect temper and ſound conſtitution; as being the immediate workmanſhip of the Holy Ghoſt, by whom it was compoſed and framed in his mothers wombe without any the leaſt help or aſſiſtance of man at all; now, the ſtronger and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the complexion is, the more lively and vigorous are the ſenſes; and ſo the more ſenſible either of paine or pleaſure, according as the objects are diverſified. Thirdly, to make it yet more full; ſuch was the exceſſe of Chriſts love to man, intending a plenteous Redemption, that hee would not ſuffer his ſtrength as in a dying man to languiſh and decay by degrees, that ſo in the cloſe nothing at all ſhould remaine; but even to his laſt breath, he would retaine that vigor in him, that he might fully feel the ſmartnes of his pains, <hi>à principio paſſionis uſ<expan>

                     </expan> ad finem,</hi> from the firſt of his paſſion, to the laſt, which that ſtrong cry of his, when hee gave up the ghoſt doth witneſſe. For the Text ſayes, that, <hi>clamavit voce magna, &amp; expiravit;</hi> He cryed with a loud voyce, or great cry, and gave up the ghoſt, <hi>Marke</hi> 15.37. which ſtrong cry ſhewes that nature was ſtrong in him: For, <hi>non ſolent moribundi exclamare;</hi> dying-men are not accuſtomed to cry out ſo loud. So that there is no queſtino to be made, he might have lived longer, but that (all things being once accompliſhed to make our Redemption perfect and intire) he would now die: Thereby to ſhew himſelfe to be Lord both of life and death. The rareneſſe and ſtrangeneſſe of which act wrought as rare and ſtrange an effect in the Centurion which heard it; For the hearing of him cry thus, made him to cry out too, <hi>verè hic homo filius Dei erat,</hi> Truely this man was the Sonne

               <p>The fourth and laſt is the depth thereof, which conſiſts in this; That Chriſts paſſion was a full and ſolid paſſion, that is, an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and pure paſſion, not mixt with any comfort to mitigate and eaſe it. Our cup of ſorrowes is never in that extremity of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but that there is ſtill ſome ſugar mingled with our gall; ſome ſweet caſt upon our ſower; ſome conſolation tempered with our affliction. As for inſtance, it is deemed one great comfort in adverſity to have ſome of our friends about us, to condole and lament with us in our ſorrowes. But alas, in the very entrance of his troubles, Chriſt is abandoned of all. His Diſciples, as you have heard, when this heavie ſtorme begins to fall upon him, forſake and leave him; one of them forſwears him, another runs away naked, rather than he will ſtay and confeſſe him; who then ſhall comfort him? Himſelfe? Sometimes indeed our owne thoughts find a way to ſuccour us, unknowne to others (as my Lord Biſhop of Exeter well obſerves) but alas, with him at this time it is not ſo: For his ſoule is filled with evill; as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh in his perſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.3. who then ſhall doe it? His Father? Here, here was his hope, <hi>ſed proh dolor!</hi> but out alas, no comfort as yet appeares from him; For hee delivers him into the hands of his enemies; and when he hath done, turnes his backe upon him as a ſtranger, ſhewing no compaſſion on his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather wounds him as an enemy.

               <p>And thus you ſee, not onely how, but why alſo Chriſt was crucified, aſwell in his adverſaries, as his owne counſell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:175623:60"/> They out of malice and hatred towards him; Hee out of love and pity to us; ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> and was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified upon the Croſſe. A word or two for uſe and application, and ſo we will conclude theſe two circumſtances of this Article.</p>
               <p>Did Chriſt then ſuffer ſuch things, yea, and farre greater then thoſe that you have heard related unto you? (The afflictions and anguiſhes of the ſoule, being much worſe then thoſe of the body, (Theſe being but love trickes ſayth one, to what his ſoule indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) which notwithſtanding wee have but ſlightly toucht upon; as not altogether, in my judgement, ſo properly appertaining and belonging to the <hi>Creed</hi>) why then we ſhall doe well, a little to examine and conſider the end and cauſes why he did ſo: which if wee doe, we ſhall finde, that it was not his owne, but our ſinne that brought all this evill upon him, according to that of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Chriſt ſuffered for us, leaving us an example to doe the like, who did no ſinne himſelfe, neither was there guile found in his mouth, but they were our ſinnes which he bore in his body on the tree, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.21, 22. <hi>verſes,</hi> as the Prophet likewiſe had foretold, ſaying, he hath taken upon him our infirmities, and he hath caried our ſorrowes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.4. We have an uſuall ſaying amongſt us, that <hi>Charitas à ſemetipſa incipit;</hi> charity begins at home, but Chriſts charity yee ſee did not: for it began, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ended all in us: ſo that whatſoever our Saviour, either <hi>Ferebat</hi> or <hi>gerebat,</hi> as one ſayth, either did, or abid, it was for us, both, <hi>Natus nobis &amp; datus nobis, Eſay</hi> 9.6.<note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Clarke.</hi>
                  </note> Hee was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of the wombe for us, and he was delivered up to the Croſſe for us.

               <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> then are not the onely actors in this tragick ſtory of Chriſts ſuffering under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> and crucifying on the croſſe: But we are as deepe in as they, nay deeper in then they, as being the principalls, and they onely but acceſſaries thereunto.

(For for ſuch clients, I believe never any man was ſo leud as to become an advocate) but onely to let men ſee and know, yea, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge too, the greatneſſe and grievouſneſſe of their ſinnes; the cure whereof occaſioned all theſe fearefull evills upon our bleſſed Saviour, before it could be throughly accompliſhed and effected. For <hi>hoc fonte derivata clades;</hi> all the fore ſpoken of and laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed afflictions and troubles of his proceed onely from this fountaine and originall. So that we, ſinfull we, bound him with cords, beate him with rods, buffeted him with fiſts, crown'd him with Thornes, yea wee reviled him and railed on him with our tongues; we nodded at him with our heads, we thruſt him through with ſpeares, we betrayed him with a kiſſe; We peirced his Hands and Feete with nailes, we condemned him with falſe witneſſes, we powred ſhame and contempt upon his perſon; we judged him as plagued and ſmitten of God.

                  </label> What an hatred then ſhould this beget and kindle in us againſt our ſins, that were thus the ſpoylers of our Saviours life and the ſpillers of his blood? How ſhould wee in an holy revenge purſue them to death, that were the authors of his death; kill them that killed him? But woe, woe unto us, ſo far are we from this, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:175623:61"/> of mortifying and crucifying them, we crucify him; as if to have done it once had not beene ſufficient, but that as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, wee muſt crucify againe the Sonne of God, and make a mocke of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. ſo that we may uſe S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> though in another ſenſe, Jeſus Chriſt is evidently ſet forth before our eyes and crucified amongſt us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1.</p>
               <p>Thus hypocriſie bends the knee with ludibrious devotion, and bids, Hayle King of the Jewes; Preſumption puts a reed, a rod, and ſcepter into his hands: The children of darkneſſe buffet and beat him; yea, and bid him propheſie who ſmote him. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſpit in his face: The ſacrilegious caſt lots for his garment: the Schiſmaticall divide his ſeameleſſe Coat, which the rude ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers did not. <hi>Popularity</hi> waſhes her hands as innocent, yea to pleaſe men condemnes Chriſt. The drunkards in their carowſes and unhallowed healths, give him a potion of Gall. Bribery, extortion, covetouſneſſe, uncleanneſſe, and all other kinds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary ſinnes, preferre <hi>Barabbas</hi> before him. <hi>Simony</hi> crucifies him betweene two Theeves. <hi>Hereſy</hi> rackes his bones and disjoynts him. <hi>Superſtition</hi> betrayes him with a kiſſe and deſpights him with ſeeming honours. <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> denies him with his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> yea and forſweares him too. The roarers with laughs and ſcoffes crucify him afreſh: and with their blaſphemy and outragious oathes, teare (O cauſe of teares) his Nayles, his Sides, his Fleſh, his Hands, his Armes, his Bones, and all his Joynts, and Members a ſunder. Theſe are our offerings for Chriſt his ſufferings.</p>
               <p>But Oh beloved, was it not enough that hee died once for us, but that wee through theſe our ſinnes muſt put him to death ſtill? Were thoſe paines of his ſo little and ſo light, that wee ſhould every day redouble them? Is this the entertainement that ſo gracious a Saviour hath deſerved by dying for us? Is this the recompenſe of that infinite love of his, that we ſhould thus cruelly vex and wound him with our ſinnes? If compaſſion of his ſmart cannot moove us; yet let compaſſion of our owne ſoules prevaile with us. For how can we hope or expect to finde redemption by his Blood, while wee continue by our horrid and heynous ſinnes to make new gaſhes in his Sides; to rub his Wounds afreſh and cauſe them ſtreame a new, that were even cloſed up before? An act more <hi>Iewiſh,</hi> then that of the <hi>Jewes</hi> themſelves. Let us then at the laſt for ſhame, by our true and unfeyned Repentance,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:175623:62"/> forſake that tyrant ſinne, which detaineth us in ſervitude, ſhake off his Chaines, cut aſunder his Bands, and by a lively faith run ſtrongly, violently and ſpeedily unto Chriſt, who hangeth on the Croſſe, as you have heard and ſeene, <hi>Habens ibi caput incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum ad oſculandum, cor apertum ad diligendum; &amp; manus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaſas ad amplexandum.</hi> Having, not onely his Head bowed downe there to kiſſe us, and his Heart open to love us: but his Hands alſo ſtretched out wide to imbrace us, and receive us upon our firſt returne. And therefore returne, O <hi>Shulamite</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, returne, as it is ſaid, <hi>Can.</hi> 6.12. and this ſufficeth for the firſt uſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hath Chriſt ſuffered all theſe things under <hi>Pontius Pilate?</hi> and beene content to have beene crucified on the Croſſe alſo, onely out of love to us? Why then ſurely this requireth a returne of our love likewiſe backe againe unto him. For <hi>nimis durus eſt animus, qui ſi dilectionem nolit impendere, nolit rependere.</hi> It is too bad a diſpoſition, that will neither offer love, nor requite it being offered, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeakes.</p>
               <p>If then there be any ſparke of ingenuity, or dramme of good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in us, let us not deny him the affection of our love, that ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the effuſion of his owne blood for us, but from ſo many ſprings as he had members, dranke ſalvation unto us in a full cup thereof. And as a part of our love, being as the fuell to keepe that fire of his love ſtill burning on the Altar of our hearts; let us againe and againe conſider what Chriſt hath ſuffered for us. For the fruits and benefits of the frequent commemoration of Chriſt his paſſion, <hi>nec pauci ſunt, nec parvi,</hi> ſaith one, are neither few nor ſmall, but theſe foure at the leaſt, <hi>cuſtodia à peccatis, ſpes firmior, praeſumptio infirmior, charitas flagrantior,</hi> it will keepe and preſerve us from falling into notorious ſins and delioquencies, ſtrengthen and confirme our hope, weaken and abate our preſumption; and laſtly, kindle and inflame our love and charity, as well among our ſelves as towards him and his heavenly Father, which laſt I have eſpecially choſen to inlarge upon at this time.

For where a Teſtament is, there muſt needs be the death of him that made the Teſtament; for the Teſtament is confirmed when men are dead, for it is yet of no force as long as he that made it is alive; wherefore neither was the firſt ordained without blood Heb. 9.15, 16, 17, 18. verſes, O come and hearken then what God hath done for our ſoules, <hi>ut animas noſtras eriperet, animam ſuam poſuit;</hi> he hath laid downe his owne life that hee may ſave ours, <hi>&amp; ut me à morte eriperet,</hi>

               <p>Againe, hereby the ſecond death is alſo quite taken away, from all that are by a true and lively faith ingrafted into Chriſt. There being no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> concludeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. anſwerable to that of <hi>Auſtin. Mors Chriſti ſimpla, mortem noſtram duplam deſiruxit:</hi> The ſingle death of Chriſt, hath deſtroyed that double death of ours, unto which we were all lyable by reaſon of our ſinnes. And therefore as the ſame Father ſaith elſewhere, <hi>O quam bene te tuo impetu diabole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſiſti:</hi> How well hath the Devill wounded himſelfe through his owne violence, ſeeing his cruelty in ſparing none, no not Gods owne Sonne; hath brought life and ſafety to others; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and confuſion onely to himſelfe.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t injuſta mors, juſtam vinceret mortem:</hi> That his undeſerved death might free them from death that had deſerved it. <hi>Et liberaret reos juſte, dum pro eis occidebatur injuſte,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſtill: and that he might acquit and diſcharge thoſe that were guilty, becauſe he that was guiltleſſe or not guilty was put to death for them: whereby becauſe <hi>Non habebat peccata propria digne delevit aliena:</hi> He that had no ſinnes of his owne did worthily blot out the ſins of other men. He gave up the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>And here I might diſmiſſe this point, had I not promiſed you at my firſt entrance into this diſcourſe, to ſhew you a <hi>Quis</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quis.</note> aſwell as a <hi>Quid:</hi> Who ſuffered as well as what. For here, if any where, is the moſt proper place to bring it in. For ſeeing we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at large, aſwell in our former as in this preſent tract; that (He) was the ſecond Perſon of the ſacred Trinity that tooke our
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:175623:65"/> nature upon him, and in it ſuffered all theſe things under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> for our ſakes; why, here may ariſe the greateſt difficulty and doubt of all the reſt, whether He could alſo dye. Whether He that is God of God; yea, very God of very God; of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the Father, and therefore equall to him as touching his god-head; by whom alſo were all things made that were made, and ſo is Lord likewiſe both of life and death; whether this ſo great, ſo good a perſon, could be ſubject unto death himſelfe, becauſe our Creed tels us, not onely that He ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> &amp; was crucified, but that he dyed too; which to our naturall reaſon and humane capacities, ſeemes (I muſt confeſſe) to have two abſurdities, if not impoſſibilities in it, at the leaſt. The one that Chriſt ſhould dye, being without ſinne, ſeeing death is the wages onely of ſinne, as you have heard already out of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. The other that he could, being the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>For the ſalving and ſolving of which latter doubt (the former being ſufficiently cleared before) we muſt know, that God, in the perſon of Chriſt, might dye, though the God-head could not. For being a mixt perſon conſiſting of two natures, as of God-head and Manhood in one and the ſame ſubject; the one paſſible and mortall, and the other impaſſible and immortall: that which was humane and paſſible might ſuffer and dye, <hi>Citra ullam divinitatis injuriam ac detrimentum:</hi> without any detriment or injury to the other.<note place="margin">Ser. <hi>64.</hi> in Evang. Ioh.</note> So that, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mortuus eſt filius dei, ſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum carnem mortuus; non ſecundum verbum quod caro factum eſt.</hi> The Sonne of God is indeed dead, but it is onely in his fleſh which he tooke from us; not as he is the word of God which tooke our fleſh, and thereby dwelleth in us: but in that he dyed, <hi>De noſtro mortuus eſt,</hi> it is onely in what he had from us; as in that we live, <hi>de ipſius vivimus,</hi> it is alone by that life which we receive from him. <hi>Nec potuit mori de ſuo, nec vivere de noſtro:</hi> So that as he could not dye in his owne nature, ſo he could not but dye in ours, unleſſe he would ſtill have been obnoxious and lyable to the accuſation of the Devill and all other adverſaries, of not taking really and truly our humane dying nature upon him.</p>
               <p>And therefore as in the birth of Chriſt, humility was aſſumed by Majeſty, weakneſſe and infirmity by power, and mortality by eternity; that ſo a perfect mediatour might be found to reconcile God and his ſinneful creatures together; ſo for the finall finiſhing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:175623:65"/> of the ſayd reconciliation and atonement; and for the paying of our nature his due by death: the inviolable and impaſſible nature of God, is likewiſe united to our nature that is paſſible, that ſo the ſaid Mediatour may become able to performe all things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for our redemption, by ſuffering and dying in our nature, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though otherwiſe he could neither ſuffer nor dye in his owne.</p>
               <p>And not onely able to doe it, but truely active alſo in the doing of it:<note place="margin">Compend. Theol. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> For <hi>paſſibilitas ad ſatisfaciendum vel merendum non ſufficit ſine paſſione in Actu,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpeakes. Paſſibility or a power to ſuffer is not ſufficient to merit at Gods hands, or make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for our ſinnes, without actuall ſuffering indeed. No man being reckoned or accounted either good or evill by his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity alone to doe ſuch and ſuch things; but onely becauſe he hath or doth actuate and performe them. <hi>Nec laus aut vituperium de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentur potentiae ſed actui,</hi> as he goes on: ſo that praiſe or diſpraiſe is not properly due to powers, but only to Acts. In regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt tooke unto himſelfe: <hi>Non ſolum paſſibilitatem noſtram ut nos ſalvaret,</hi> not onely our paſſibility and power to ſuffer or dye, but that he might perfect and accompliſh our redemption to the full, and ſtop the mouth of all accuſers whatſoever whether wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men or evill Angels, he did truly and indeed both ſuffer and dye; undergoing all things for us, which by reaſon of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers fall, we ſhould have undergone our ſelves: the chiefe whereof is death, <hi>ad quam omnes aliae paſſiones humanae ordinantur ſicut ad ultimum:</hi> unto which all other humane paſſions doe tend and are directed as to their laſt end. Thus far <hi>Aquinas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you ſee (beloved) how Chriſt the Sonne of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of two diſtinct natures aſwell divine as humane, ſhould and could, might and did ſuffer and dye, <hi>Salva tamen proprietate utri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque naturae:</hi> The property and propriety of each nature notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding being ſtil preſerved and reſerved to it ſelfe intire. As for inſtance, by the vertue and power of his divine nature, he cauſed the ſouldiers and band of men which came to apprehend and take him, to goe backwards and fall to the ground: whereas in the weakenes of his humane nature, he was afterwards apprehended, bound, impriſoned, carryed before ſeverall Judges, ſcourged, ſpit upon, derided, buffered, and at laſt condemned as guilty. Againe by the vertue and power of his divine nature, he converted day into night at the time of his paſſion; and cauſed all the elements to tremble and ſhake for dread: and yet in the weakneſſe of his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:175623:66"/> humane nature; his hands were faſtened with nayles unto the wood of the Croſſe, and his whole body ſtretched out upon it. By the vertue and power of his divine nature he opened againe the gates of Paradiſe to the good theefe: And in the weakneſſe and imbecillity of his humane nature, in the greateſt depth and hurle of all his troubles, he cryes out unto his Father, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> By the vertue, and in the power of his divine nature, he offered up prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong cryings and teares, unto him that was able to ſave him from death; and was alſo heard in that which he feared, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes; <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. whereas in the infirmity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his humane nature, hee yeelded up his ſpirit with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of it into his Fathers hands; and gave up the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>In all which paſſages of his Paſſion, then yee ſee, his divinity was never totally eclipſt, but ſtill ſends forth ſome beames of his might and majeſty, even in the midſt of his greateſt weakneſſe and infirmity; and all to let us ſee and know, that though his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſuffer and dye, yet is his God-head ſtill perfect and intire. And therefore though wee heare much and often of the death of Chriſt the Sonne of God; yet let us not be offended, nor troubled at it; conſidering the admirable efficacie of it. In being, as full of horrour and terrour to the wicked: ſo of comfort and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the godly. So that in nothing is that ſaying of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle more true, then in the death of Chriſt. <hi>Virtus in infirmitate perficitur,</hi> Power and ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſſe: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.<note place="margin">De duplici Martyrio.</note> For as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ibi fracta eſt Satanae Tyrannis; ibi devicti ſunt inferi; ibi triumphatum eſt de Diabolo; ibi dejectus orcus, coelum apertum, &amp;c.</hi> Therein is the tyranny of Satan bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the infernall powers overthrowne; the Devill ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the Principalities of Hell dejected; and Heaven it ſelfe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to all true and faithfull beleevers. So that, as hee goes on, <hi>Quid homine mortuo contemptius? quis enim vel Caeſarem mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um metuat? ſed Chriſti morte quid efficacius? velum Templi ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum eſt; terra concuſſa; ſaxa diſciſſa; monumenta aperta, &amp;c.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though nothing be more contemptible then a dead man, no man fearing, no not <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe, when he is once dead: yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more efficacious and powerfull then the death of Chriſt: whereat the vayle of the Temple was rent, the earth did quake, the ſtones did cleave, and the graves did open of themſelves: ſo that many bodies of the Saints which ſlept aroſe, as it is ſaid <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.51, 52. <hi>verſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:175623:66"/>
               <p>A reaſon of which powerfull effects, is this: that although the ſoule and body of Chriſt were ſeparated aſunder by his death, <hi>à neutro tamen horum receſſerit divinitas;</hi> yet his divinity was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from neither: But, <hi>Tam Dei virtus in Chriſto, ex operibus quae fecit, apparuit; quam fragilitas hominis ex paſſione quam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulit,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſpeakes.<note place="margin">Inſt. l. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> The power of his God-head manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted it ſelfe in theſe his powerfull workes; aſwell as the frailty of his man-hood, in thoſe other things which he ſuffered.</p>
               <p>So that, <hi>Factus eſt homo, ſuſcipiendo quod non erat; non perdendo quod erat,</hi> as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeakes: Although,<note place="margin">Serm. <hi>60.</hi> in Iohan.</note> by being made man, he tooke that which before he was not; yet he did not looſe nor let goe any thing of what hee was: <hi>Sed manens Deus factus eſt homo,</hi> But continued God, although hee was likewiſe made man. <hi>Accepit te, non conſumptus eſt in te,</hi> as he goes on: He indeed tooke thee unto himſelfe, O man! but yet did not conſume or ſpend, waſte or diminiſh himſelfe in thee.</p>
               <p>So that wee muſt hold and beleeve, as that moſt Reverend,<note place="margin">Incarnat. of Chriſt the Sonne of God.</note> learned, and painfull Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> well obſerves: That there are two diſtinct natures in Chriſt, God-head and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; which are ſo diſtinct, as that they doe not make one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded nature: but ſtill remaine uncompounded and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together. And yet though never ſo diſtinct in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they are as firmely and fully united againe in the perſon, as can poſſibly be imagined and conceived: ſeeing in him dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily, as the Apoſtle affirmeth; <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.9. that is, by ſuch a perſonall and reall union, as doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably and everlaſtingly conjoyne that infinite Godhead, with his finite man-hood; in the unity of the ſelfe ſame individuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. So that by reaſon of the ſtrictneſſe of this perſonall union of theſe two natures in the perſon of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> whatſoever may be verified of either of thoſe natures, the ſame may be truly ſpoken of the whole perſon, from whetherſoever of the natures it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated: ſo farre Doctor <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which if it be ſo (beloved) then by this time I hope you are as well ſatisfied in the <hi>Quis,</hi> as the <hi>Quid;</hi> Who it is that ſuffered and dyed, as what he ſuffered? <hi>(viz.)</hi> even Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, which was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> as you have heard out of the former Articles: even he alſo is the He, which ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was crucified, dead, buried, &amp;c. the worlds Creator, and mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:175623:67"/> the Almighty God himſelfe. <hi>Totus Chriſtus,</hi> though not <hi>Totum Chriſti,</hi> whole Chriſt, though not all of Chriſt; was the <hi>Quis,</hi> which was the paſſive Agent, and active Patient in all theſe things: for <hi>Jeſus</hi> cryed with a loud voyce, and gave up the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Neither let it ſeeme ſtrange to any man, that that ſhould be predicated and ſpoken of the whole perſon of Chriſt, which can be verified but of one of his natures; ſeeing without any note or thought of ſtrangeneſſe at all, we do the like dayly in our owne and ordinary diſcourſes; even concerning our ſelves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per actions. For whereas the whole perſon and compound of man conſiſts of two parts; and thoſe very different in their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and operations, as of a ſoule and a body: whereof the one is carnall, the other ſpirituall: and each hath his proper actions and imployments accordingly by themſelves; as the body to eate, drinke, ſleepe, walke, runne, ride, ſuffer hunger, thirſt, heat, cold, and the like; and the ſoule to underſtand, conceive, remember, forget; to be chearefull, or ſorrowfull; angry, or well pleaſed; and ſuch like: either of which cannot truly be verified of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent part, as not the bodies actions of the ſoule; nor the ſoules operations of the body; And yet we uſually referre both, and all to the whole perſon: and that without any incongruity or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properneſſe of ſpeech; conſidering the firme union that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. So, by reaſon of the hypoſtaticall union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of properties, that is betwixt the two natures in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Divine, and Humane: That which is proper but to one, may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be predicated, and ſpoken, and applyed to the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Vigilius.</note>As alſo if man, whole man, may in himſelfe have two ſuch contrary qualities; as to be able to dye, and not to dye: To dye in his body, and not to dye in his ſoule; as our Saviour himſelfe hath taught us: ſaying, Feare not thoſe that can kill your bodyes, but not your ſoules: Then much more may <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whole <hi>Chriſt,</hi> dye in one nature, and yet live in another. And in him, God be ſaid to dye too; and Man to live for ever. In him, I ſay; the ſecond Perſon onely of the Trinity. For to ſpeak it of any of the other two perſons, whether Father or Holy Ghoſt; it is no leſſe then blaſphemy: and that which never came ſo much as in the thought of any orthodoxe Chriſtian; much leſſe divine: although ſome Hereticks there have beene called <hi>Patro-paſſioni,</hi> which have ſeem'd to atribute ſuffering to the Father.<note place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Clarke.</note> But a learned Clarke of our owne calls it an unlearned hereſie, ſprung of Scriptures miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued,

                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:175623:68"/> that is, Every Chriſtian is by ſo much the nearer to perfection, by how much he is more perfectly and truely ſenſible of anothers miſeries and afflictions, and then ſurely much more, when it is of the miſeries and afflictions of his bleſſed Saviour himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And therefore as he hath had compaſſion on us, for the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which we by our ſinnes have procured to our ſelves; ſo let us have compaſſion on him, for the ſufferings which our miſeries likewiſe have procured unto him. For there is no reaſon, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he out of his love did vouchſafe to ſuffer and dye for us; that we ſhould be ſo ingratefull and unthankfull as not to be willing to ſuffer with him. It is Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> juſt complaint againſt the mercileſſe and hard-hearted Jewes: that whereas all the elements were diſturbed and out of courſe at the death of Chriſt; <hi>Sola cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da Judaeorum non moventur,</hi> onely the hearts of theſe his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, could not be mollifyed and broken, no nor brought to ſhed a teare for him, that ſhed his blood, and loſt his life too for them.</p>
               <p>Which is a grievous complaint indeed: that ſeeing at the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, the vaile of the Temple was rent, the rocks did cleave, the earth was moved, the graves were opened, and the whole World was overcaſt with the mournfull darkneſſe of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and lamentation (as you have heard before) as if it did all ſuffer with him, <hi>ſolus homo non compateretur pro quo ſolo Chriſtus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur.</hi> Theſe ſhould ſuffer for whom Chriſt ſuffered not, and only man be found void of compaſſion, for whom alone he ſuffered this paſſion.</p>
               <p>O let us then (beloved) imitate and follow his example, and not theirs: For his words towards them are as ſmooth and ſoft as oyle, when as their both words and workes towards him, are no other, no better then very ſwords: crying out againſt him, Let him be crucyfied, let him be crucified, when as he prayes for them: Father forgive them, they know not what they doe.

For therein, ſaith he, is our dayly warfare finiſhed; death extinguiſhed; the curſe removed; the tyranny of the Devill diſſolved; and his veſſels broken aſunder and taken from him. God is become reconciled unto men; the Heavens made paſſable and penetrable, all diſtances conjoyned; the hedge removed; the windowes opened, and men and Angels brought to converſe together: ſo that the God of peace hath pacified and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed all differences whatſoever both in Heaven and in Earth. And for this cauſe doe I call this, <hi>The Great Weeke</hi> (ſaith he) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe herein the Lord hath conferred ſuch a many and multitude of his Great gifts amongſt us. In regard whereof alſo it is, That all the Faithfull doe the more diligently at this time, apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the works of mortification, faſtings, watchings, nightly devotions, and deeds of charity, <hi>Tam dando quam condonando,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in giving to thoſe that want, as forgiving thoſe that have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended us; that ſo they may ſeeme to give honour more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to this Time and Weeke; in which the Lord above others hath ſo farre benefitted, bleſſed, yea and honoured us. Nay (as he proceeds to ſay) Kings and Rulers themſelves are not aſhamed to let it appeare, how venerable and ſacred they hold theſe dayes; by commanding a ceſſation and reſt from civill Functions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; ſhutting up the dores of all Judiciall Courts and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Judicature, and by removing out of the way for this time all ſhewes of difference and debate, ſtrife and contention amongſt men, whereby with the greater freedome, tranquility and peace of minde; <hi>Liceat ad ſpiritualia recte perficienda feſtinare;</hi> they may performe rightly and reverently their ſpirituall devotions.</p>
               <p>And not onely ſo, <hi>Sed &amp; aliam liberalitatem oſtendunt;</hi> They ſhew their bounty and liberality alſo another way; and that is this: by letting looſe priſoners, and granting their pardon and releaſe to ſuch as are in durance at this time; that ſo they may
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:175623:70"/> imitate and follow the example of our Lord himſelfe. Becauſe, <hi>Sicut ipſe gravi nos peccatorum carcere exolvit, &amp; innumeris bonis frui fecit: eodem modo &amp; nobis faciendum eſt, ut ſimus imitatores miſericordiae Domini noſtri:</hi> As hee hath ſet us free from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our ſinnes, and made us partakers of many happineſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: ſo ought we to ſhew mercy unto others, as he hath done to us; according to his owne precept in the Goſpell, Be yee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, as your heavenly Father is mercifull: <hi>Luke</hi> 6.36. And thus you ſee, how we may, and ought all to honour and celebrate this Time and Week; in which ſo much good hath beene done, and kindneſſe ſhewne unto us. So that I beſeech you, (as mine Author Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> concludes) that now, if at any time, you would bee pleaſed to lay aſide all your vaine and worldly cares and cogitations; and with pure mindes purged from all impieties and corruptions, as well of fleſh as ſpirit, you would with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and watchfulneſſe attend to your devotions.

Which argues the ſincerity of their affection towards him; though as yet they durſt not openly confeſſe him for feare of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> And it was more fittingly done by theſe, then it could have beene done by his knowne Diſciples; becauſe, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Ser. <hi>117.</hi> de Temp.</note>

               <p>The cauſes thereof is the next thing to be conſidered; which are aſſigned by Writers upon this ſubject to bee diverſe.

For living men uſe not to be buried, but only ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are dead. To which purpoſe alſo ſome other parts and paſſages of his Paſſion may be urged and alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed As that a Souldier thruſt a ſpeare into his ſide. That he was taken downe from the Croſſe, ſo ſoone as they perceived him to be dead indeed. That they annoynted and imbalmed him to the buriall, and wrapped him in linnen clothes; and the like. For as by touching, handling, and ſeeing of him; as alſo by his eating of broyled fiſh afterwards, and part of an honey-combe; we conclude the truth of his Reſurrection: ſo by theſe other circumſtances, the truth of his death.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that in his Grave he might bury all our ſinnes; for which that curſe was impoſed on us: <hi>In pulverem reverteris,</hi> Thou ſhalt returne to duſt:<note place="margin">Compend. Theol. c. <hi>49.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. For as <hi>Aquinas</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, Sinne hath brought upon us, not onely infirmities and afflictions in the time of our lives; but defects alſo even after our death, aſwell in our bodies as our ſoules. In our ſoules, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the loweſt Lake, contrary to the nature of ſpirituall eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which ſhould aſcend rather to the higheſt heavens: and in our bodies, to returne againe to the earth from whence they were taken; contrary to the Law of our Creation, which was to have beene ſo quickned by the ſpirit of life, as not to have died at all; but to have liv'd together with the ſoule for ever.</p>
               <p>Now this defect of our bodies, is to bee conſidered (as our School-man ſpeakes) <hi>Secundum poſitionem, &amp; ſecundum reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem;</hi> either according to its poſition, or reſolution. Its poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is onely to be laid in the ground; Its reſolution, is alſo to be diſſolved into the firſt elements of which it was compacted and compoſed. The former of theſe Chriſt would, &amp; did undergoe, but not the latter; according to that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt: Non dabis ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum tuum videre corruptionem;</hi> Thou ſhalt not ſuffer thy holy
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:175623:71"/> One to ſee corruption: (<hi>viz.</hi> by the putrefaction of his body) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10.</p>
               <p>The reaſon whereof is this; becauſe as the matter or materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Chriſts body comming from the nature of man; was in regard thereof to be returned to 'its proper and accuſtomed place under the ground: (<hi>Locus enim corporibus debetur ſecundum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriam praedominantis elementi;</hi> that is, Place is due to bodies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the matter of the predominant element, which is Earth.) So the frame and compoſure of his body, comming not from man; but from the vertue, and power, and workemanſhip of the Holy Ghoſt, was not to be diſſolved: neither would he, or did he undertake it; becauſe herein he was ſingular, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from other men. Thus farre <hi>Aquinas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee was therefore buried, to ſhew that wee by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme are buried with him into death; (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) that like as hee was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father; even ſo wee alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe of life: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he was buryed and reſted in his grave the whole day of the Jewes Sabbath, that he might ſanctify an eternall Sabbath of reſt unto his children, unto which although they were at firſt created; yet (by reaſon of ſinne and the Devils malice) they had been deprived, unleſſe he had dyed and been thus buryed to reſtore it againe unto them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, he was buryed, to the end that he might hallow the earth by his ſacred body, to become a receptacle of reſt for the receiving of our bodyes alſo: Which muſt needs be a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the godly to know and beleeve, how that by his grave and buryall; he hath ſweetly perfumed our graves wherein we ſhall be buryed: and inſtead of ſtinking houſes of perdition, hath made them chambers of quiet reſt and ſleepe unto us: ſo that as the Prophet ſaith, Peace ſhall come and they ſhall reſt in their beds (that is, their graves) every one that walketh before him, <hi>Eſay</hi> 57.2.</p>
               <p>And in theſe reſpects, and ſundry others which might be thought upon: The buryall of Chriſt, is eſteemed by ſome Ancient Fathers, to be more h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:175623:72"/> forth a body which was mortall, ſo that it both could, and did dye; whereas this reſtored and returned it immortall, and which can dye no more; but liveth and abideth now for ever. And as after his birth, he fell into many tortures and troubles, miſeries, and afflictions in this life: ſo after his buryall he hath paſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from death to life in the land of the living: So that <hi>Religioſior plane eſt iſta quam illa nativitas,</hi> as the Father goes on. This latter birth of his, is more to be celebrated and held ſacred then the former; becauſe in that the Lord of the whole World was kept cloſe priſoner, nine months together in his Mothers wombe; whereas this detained him only three dayes in the wombe of the earth. In which reſpect, <hi>Illa cunctorum ſpem tardius protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit: Haec omnium ſalutem citius ſuſcitavit,</hi> That is ſaid, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay our hope, and this to finiſh more ſpeedily our Salvation. In regard whereof alſo the Prophet ſaith: That <hi>Sepulchrum ejus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit glorioſum,</hi> as the vulgar Latine reads it: <hi>Eſay</hi> 11.10. that is, His Sepulcher or buriall ſhall be glorious: not by reaſon of the ſtatelineſſe of his tombe; or magnificence of the pompe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity at his buriall. For herein it is very likely that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher and ſepulture of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and many other earthly Princes, might farre outſtrippe and overgoe him, exceed and excell him much: but onely, <hi>Quia ex morte ad vitam &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam aeternam revixit,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Chitraeus;</hi> becauſe herehence hee paſſed preſently from death to life, and from mortality to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and eternall glory: whereas all thoſe great Monarchs of the World, aſwell as meaner perſons; remaine under deaths arreſt till this preſent day, and ſo are like to continue to the Worlds end.</p>
               <p>And therefore, although theſe Potentates of the earth can find neither comfort nor glory in their grave, though they goe with never ſo much pompe and glory to it: Yet wee which are Chriſtians, doe expect and looke for both by reaſon of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryall of this our Saviour who (as you have heard) hath hereby ſanctifyed our graves to be unto us as our beds, wherein our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes reſt from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:175623:72"/>
               <p>And laſtly, to conclude; we may from this buryall and ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, learne and note the civill uſe of the grave, to be neceſſary and fitting for all perſons and people whatſoever, to bury their dead out of ſight, and from annoyance, and offence that they may otherwiſe come from their deceaſed bodyes. It being reckoned among the bleſſings of God, to be decently and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought unto our graves, and ſo layd and put into them; and not to be caſt out as wile carkaſſes to the beaſts of the field, or foules of the ayre: as it was threatned and impoſed as a curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> to be buryed as an Aſſe is buryed; even drawne and caſt forth without the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem, Jer.</hi> 22.19.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Diogenes</hi> is too curriſh and uncivill to ſay, Caſt me out and lay a ſtaffe by me; as ſeeming to take no thought for ſeemely buryall at all: whereas the Saints of God have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes had a ſpeciall care of it. <hi>Abraham</hi> purchaſing a poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of buryall (the firſt purchaſe that we read of in the booke of God) wherein to bury his dead out of his ſight, as yee may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.4. And the Sonne of God himſelfe (the ſubject of our diſcourſe at this time) ſubmitting and permitting his body after his death to be put into a decent and comely grave; as here you ſee.</p>
